	<p>Lord Jesus, we pray that you would give us<p>
	<p><a href=''>ears to hear</a>, <a href=''>hearts to love</a>, and <a href=''>wills devoted to serve</a>.</P>
	<p>That in the days to come, this congregation would be known, not for our glory, but for yours alone.</P>
	<p>That this place would be an oasis, a place where people come to find out about you, where lives are straightened out and made whole;</p>
	<p>a place where people find the peace that passes all understanding. </P>
	<p>Give us a heart to desire these things above all else we pray. Amen</p>

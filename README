AldieChurch.com is currently in Drupal.  Key problems:
1. Posting new stuff is too complicated
2. The current host (AMHosting) turned on Safe Mode, causing a warning mesage we don't like
3. Permnissions are such that we can't upload pictures or anthing like that.

Basically, all of this is causing me to want to redo this project as a whole new site done in WordPress.
Yes, I'm being a bit selfish in wanting to build a portfolio, but hey, this is my demo.

In 1853 Meade Parish was divided into two parts.  The eastern half was organized as Johns Parish, taking its name from the Reverend John Johns, the 4th bishop of Virginia.  The new parish included the towns of Upperville, Middleburg and Aldie with the rectory located in Upperville.\n\n In 1885 the parish was again reorganized, excluding Upperville but including Oatlands. In 1945 Johns Parish was to consist of Middleburg’s Emmanuel and Aldie’s Church of Our Redeemer. Oatlands became an independent church.\n\n There was no Episcopal church Building in Aldie before 1890, and services had been held in the Union Church on the site of today’s Presbyterian Church.  In 1849, that town lot and the building erected thereon were transferred to trustees, John Moore, Thomas Boyle, Robert Ish and William Rawlings for these purposes:  the building to be used as a place of public worship free to Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians, and the lot to be appropriated for and used exclusively as a graveyard.\n \n While there are no plans and pictures of the original building, it is believed to have been built of brick (probably burned on site) in the same style and possibly of the same size as historic Mt. Zion Church just east of Aldie on Route 50.  The free Church, located, naturally on Aldie’s Meeting House Lane, was sold to the trustees of the Presbyterian Church for the sum of five dollars in 1892.  By then the other denominations had built and moved into churches of their own.					\n\n It was during this time that vestry records of Redeemer were sparsely kept, and indeed, the church was not known as Our Redeemer until it was so named in 1890.  Parishioner Henry Fairfax then owner of Oak Hill, the former estate of President James Monroe who retired to Loudoun County after his White House years, decided that Aldie needed an Episcopal church for its congregation from that village and nearby areas.  Mr. Fairfax and his neighbors, though already pew-holders and contributors at Emmanuel, would build one.\n\n The word was long handed down that the church was built entirely at Mr. Fairfax’s expense, and possibly so, but we know that his brother, Hamilton Rogers Fairfax of New York donated the pine and walnut pews, also the chancel furniture including the pulpit and lectern, that Vestryman John  Moore had installed the lovely stained glass window above the altar as a memorial to his wife Lucy Berkeley Moore, and that many of the other church furnishings were placed there by the Moore and diZerega families who figured largely in Redeemer’s early history.  However else the little white clapboard church came about, we know that Henry Fairfax deeded a plot of land on the southwest corner of his Oak Hill property fronting on the Little River Turnpike to Johns Parish and the Church of Our Redeemer came into existence.  We have only one pinpoint to its building date.  In the “Enterprise” column of the Loudoun Mirror, an early Loudoun County newspaper was found this item: \n\nALDIE VA., June 24, 1890.  “Our Episcopal friends have recently completed a very neat church in Aldie and expect to open it for service early in July.”\n\n The columnist known only as “Observer” also mentioned that the Little River Baptist Church would be dedicated the next Sunday, holding services all the day and the Saturday before.\n\n In the style of the time, Our Redeemer sat firmly on its stone foundation, its steep roof cover a 30’ by 47’ rectangular sanctuary with ribbed vaulted ceiling.  The interior, narthex doors, and windows followed a much-modified gothic design, all so simple as to warrant its being “a small country church” which, indeed, it has been ever since, despite its somewhat elegant furnishings.  While the building itself reflects the area, the furnishings reflect the Victorian era in which it was built.  Brass, carved walnut, cut glass, ornate silver and a marble font are still being enhanced by stained glass and needlepoint.\n\n When the new Parish House was being designed in 1997, the most important feature to the congregation was that it be architecturally compatible with the present church building, keeping the Moore window completely intact.  That this was done warrants tribute not only to today’s planners and builders but to the tastes and talents of our founding fathers.\n\n In its earliest days, whether Johns Parish Episcopalians met for worship in the free churches of Aldie or Middleburg, at Emmanuel, or finally at Our Redeemer, they followed the low- church ritual.  Because of their life-styles---farmers, millers, a few statesmen, wheelwrights, or small businessmen, --- the vestries chose not to stress those high-church traditions of more sophisticated parishes.  It was not until the early nineteen seventies that low-church ritual at Our Redeemer began subtly changing.  New prayer books, even new hymnals, the open-mindedness of bishops and the willingness of our ministers and congregations to accept change paved the way toward a more ecumenical attitude, thus more formal ritual.\n\n In the forties, except for kneeling to pray and following the prayer book, the service at Our Redeemer was the same as in any other Aldie church.  In fact, the only Sunday school in town was at the Presbyterian Church and some Episcopal members went there at 10:30 after 9:30 Redeemer services.  With change from low- church happening so slowly, it was easy to accept the processional cross, elevation of elements, and assistance of lay people---all things that make up our present service.  Learning to follow the newly styled bulletin and to sing the canticles in the new hymnal was much more difficult!\n	\n Some other changes in our times:  Until the seventies no woman had ever served on the vestry.  During the Rev. Neale Morgan’s tenure as pastor, a number of Our Redeemer women members were elected to that august office, and many have followed.  Helen Wallace served as the first woman Senior Warden, and Worthy Caulk as the first woman Junior Warden of Our Redeemer.\n	\n Through the years, a woman of the church were always the church organists, but since 1992 a man, John Gardecki, has taken his place at the console of our present pipe organ, given to the church by Deborah Kaylor in memory of her grandfathers, both musicians in the nineteenth century.  Redeemer has been blessed with ministers who could sing while the congregation joined in because it was a good and joyful thing to do.  Today a finely outfitted choir joins the dedicated organist in making music come alive in the church.\n	\n The history of Redeemer’s Sunday school goes back to its church beginnings when the children from the Oak Hill vicinity were driven across the fields in a pony cart by the Fairfax’s English governess, Redeemer’s first Sunday school teacher, to be met there by other children of the village.\n	\n There were years, however, when services were sparsely attended, and Sunday school not at all.  In 1950 came the request from the Women’s Auxiliary (church ladies were known as such then) that Our Redeemer have an all-purpose room suitable for Sunday school, meetings, suppers and bible school.  It was built—and a bank loan for it was paid back fully with a minimum of sacrifice but maximum effort.\n\n Vestrymen and village friends with know-how were resident engineers, contractors, and bankers.  The women of the church helped plan the moneymaking events:  Aldie old homes tours complete with plantation luncheon at Stoke, antique sales at Mercer and Berkeley houses, and the Church’s own harvest festival.  By this time the women had become more than church housekeepers and gardeners, supper organizers and Sunday school teachers. The all purpose room, constructed beneath the original church building, added 1000 ft of usable space at a cost of $8,086.31.\n\n Mrs. Henry Fairfax long outlived her husband who had been Our Redeemer’s guardian angel until his death in 1916.  For most of her years Eugenia Tennant Fairfax was a source of any information on Our Redeemer.  We quote as we remember: “Mr. Fairfax gave the land; the money for building the Episcopal Church was raised entirely by Mr. Fairfax and Captain diZerega who lived in the Mercer house.  Mr. Norris was the architect and Mr. Ambler was the builder, along with Mr. Watson.”  There was no mention anywhere of cost.  Mrs. Fairfax did say, however, that when church money was needed for any purpose, it came from the collection plates or from the goodness of parishioners’ hearts.  Pass the hat, as it were.\n  	\n From the Resolution of Memoriam by the vestry on his death: “the Hon. Henry Fairfax was a man prominent in the affairs of State and Nation but not withstanding the wide range of his interests…he kept alive an active interest in his home county and his church…always ready to do his part which would be helpful in the moral and spiritual betterment of the community in which he lived.”\n	\n Our Redeemer was very lucky to have been on the receiving end of the devotion of Henry and “Miss Eugie” Fairfax. After they purchased and moved to the old Rogers plantation west of Aldie, named “Oakham”, where Mr. Fairfax raised champion trotting horses, Oak Hill plantation passed into the hands of Mr. Frank Littleton.  It was then purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas DeLashmutt.   In1956 the DeLashmutt’s deeded land for a parking lot around Redeemer which was enlarged by yet a third gift of land from Oak Hill in 1997 when current owners, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas DeLashmutt,  Jr. donated enough acreage to more than double the parking space needed for the Parish Hall project begun in March of that year.\n	\n It is a notable fact that most of the rectors and vestries kept excellent parishioner records during the early years of Johns Parish, and before, from 1840-1853 in Meade Parish by the Reverends Slaughter, Jackson, and Wilmer.  The notes of Johns Parish were furnished intact until 1889 by the Reverends Kinsolving, Dame, Maury, Johnson, Johns and Ambler, giving names and dates for those Episcopalians who were born, baptized, confirmed, communicants, married and buried in the Parish, listed as either Middleburg or Aldie members.\n	\n Middleburg had built its own church in 1843, another “very neat and convenient” brick church given the Hebrew name of “Immanuel” according to Bishop John Johns who consecrated it.\n	\n Emmanuel also built a rectory on a near-by lot but they rented it out as a residence rather than using it themselves because the rectors who served the three charges of Middleburg, Aldie and Oatlands preferred to live halfway between them.  Aldie was chosen despite the leaking roof that had come with the former Mt. Zion Baptist rectory purchased by the Episcopalians.\n	\n The Aldie rectory was the meeting place of the combined vestries, as we have noted, but otherwise there is no telling what happened at those meetings.  Regardless of the beautiful penmanship in which the minutes were written, most of them are impossible.\n\n  It is believed, however, that excepting costs and payments --- distributions thereof ---electing vestrymen (many of whom served for years at a time), writing resolutions of appreciation and voting on the property repairs (eternally ongoing) plus electing representatives to various church conventions, nothing much of interest came about.  Though, while laboriously proceeding through vestry records from 1853-1921, many items of value did emerge.  In some instances these items were copied without reserve from the Rev. Richard H. Wilmer (1849-1852) who found no register upon taking charge of Meade Parish and merely recorded such facts in relation to the Parish prior to his rector ship as he has been able to glean from others.  One hundred and fifty years later this “small history” gatherer understands that perfectly.\n	\n  In 1853-1870, while the Rev. Kinsolving was in charge, Johns Parish was organized.  A Civil War had also raged through the land.  Births and deaths of those at home had been recorded.  We know that Aldie’s Free Church had become a hospital as had many homes of communicants who lived near area battlefields.  Dover and Aldie Mills were among the grist mills along Little River, which, used to grinding grain for neighboring farmers, turned to furnishing food for the Confederate, and in many instances, the Union Army.  Young sons of the Parish went off to war; the Rev. Kinsolving himself was taken to prison --- perhaps because of earlier secession sermons.\n	\n  Aldie became known as “a hornet’s hive.”  General J.E.B. Stuart, Col. John Mosby, and Aldie vestryman William N. Noland who formed Champe Rifles, all became Turnpike heroes. But there was no mention of the Civil War in the minutes of the vestry of either church.  There was few worship services held during the war.  The vestries did duly meet at the Aldie directory, usually on Sunday afternoons, but only to elect new members or reinstall old ones.  After 1865 the Aldie Episcopalians continued their worship at the Free Church in Middleburg which still welcomes them to its homecoming each year on the second Sunday in June.\n	\n  In 1877, then Rector William Johnson pleaded with the vestries to give consideration to his ideas of having communicants make an annual pledge to the church which they could pay through monthly installments put into the Sunday collection plates.  They did --- and we still do.   Pledge Sunday is the first Sunday in November.\n	\n  So---very little that we can see from the records happened in Johns Parish from the period following the Civil --- or War Between the States --- until 1903 when the Rev. Thomas C. Darst took charge of Johns Parish.  He wrote, “There was no evidence to show that the minutes of form in Aldie Vestry Meetings had been recorded.”\n	\n  During that cut-off period of information one very important thing did happen, however.  The Church of Our Redeemer was built and in 1903 the following vestry was elected: Henry Fairfax, John D. Moore, Littleton Turner, J. Thomas Watson, Edward Wilson, Parker Wilson, Alfred L. B. diZerega joined the vestry the following year.  The entire membership was of Aldie residents joining the long list of Aldie names like Berkeley, Adams, McVeigh, Noland, Oden, Carter, Harris --- who since the beginning had been part of Aldie’s church.  Goode, Tyler, Hutchison…\n	\n  From then on the Redeemer records are complete, although factually spare in some years: During World War I there were only quarterly vestry meetings; during World War II funds were at such a low ebb it was difficult to keep up necessary payments; vestries cut back on all but war-time emergencies. Parishioners and their personal church records are duly noted, (housed now in our new Parish House library.)  Many family names have been added through the years while many more have sadly been subtracted.\n	\n  Aldie remained a small rural town, its residents involved mainly in farming, milling, carriage and wagon building and store-keeping until not too many years ago when Route 50 allowed for better transportation into the government centers in Washington.  The Mercer-planned canal from Alexandria to Aldie did not ever get built, but Charles Fenton Mercer who founded the village left many good reminders of his life in his corner of Virginia when he was legislator and U.S. Congressman, a pusher for roads and free education.  As his village and its environment grows and changes, so does the Church of Our Redeemer.\n	\n  In 1995 there came the biggest change of all.  The Churches of Johns Parish became unyoked, each going its separate way in its ministry while remaining a part of the same parish.  Until then Emmanuel and Our Redeemer had shared the same rector --- and there must be a word here about some of those who since 1921 have pastured Aldie’s flock.\n	\n  The Rev. David Campbell Mayers --- lived in Aldie’s Rectory and was a pillar of the entire community, even joining with his wife in 1923 the Aldie Horticultural Society, founded to beautify the village, to interest school children in horticulture and to grow bulbs for sale in city markets.  Rev. Mayers was a legend in his twenty-five year stint with Episcopalians of Aldie and Middleburg.\n	\n  As was the Rev. Ernest (Froggy) de Bordenave, 1955-1967, who goes down in our history as exceptionally well-loved.  An astute businessman (“He knew everybody so could talk anyone into lending us their house for Aldie’s Old Homes Tours.”)  He was highly respected as a town leader, and believer in equal rights between the races.  Froggy’s fearless stance on integration is one of our Parish’s proudest memories.\n												\n  S. Neale Morgan followed Froggy in his public spiritedness and support of justice for all.  During his years in Middleburg and Aldie (he first lived in the Rectory in Middleburg, then he and his wife Mary Ann built their own home in Aldie.) and the FISH organization --- a volunteer effort to buy and deliver food for the needy, help pay medical and utility bills and to drive those who need it to medical facilities.  Redeemer is active with FISH and it remains on the church list of outreach supports.  For another twenty-five years the Rev. Morgan was among us --- his sermons were superb.  He brought in ordained women as his assistants, and he brought about many other changes --- but so quietly one would never guess!\n	\n  Outreach funds come from one of the two Parish jointly supported activities of long-standing.  The Rummage Sale is held in May; its funds are contributed to various places that need financial help including Seven Loaves, Abused Women’s Shelter, the Aldie Fire Department, and the Bishops Fund for World Relief, etc.  The Christmas Shop will celebrate its 50th year in November, 1999.  It has grown in leaps and bounds through the boundless energy of the women of Johns Parish, and more recently, its men.  Funds from the Christmas Shop are divided among the two churches; they are shared with the Diocese, Charities, Episcopal missions overseas, and ecumenical outreach of the National Church.\n	\n  Our Redeemer’s own fundraiser - the Shrove Tuesday’s pancake supper help relieve the burden of the church treasury. Not for funds but for fun --- we have the Blessing of the Pets in October, and the Parish Picnic in August.\n\nA small history cannot be complete without a calendar of events.\n	The Event celebrated in 1999 is the completion of the Parish House.  In 1995 it was the unyoking of the churches and Redeemer’s call to its very first own priest-in-large.  The Rev. Jane Wallace Barr accepted that call.  She is now our three-quarter time priest.\n	In a focus statement written by the vestry in 1995,m this family-sized multi-generational congregation had a vision:\n•	To expand the congregation’s size and to increase the number and variety of programs for worship, study and fellowship for children and adults.\n•	To rely to a greater extent on pledges to pay operational costs, devoting fund raising proceeds to outreach.\n•	More hands-on Congregational participation.\n•	To have a full-time Priest.\n•	To be a light in the community, providing a place of faith and fellowship for all.\n•	To promote spiritual growth and rejuvenation.\n•	To be a place where the Gospel is preached, and God glorified through the Savior, Jesus Christ.\n•	To build a Parish Hall to provide space for an office, Sunday School classrooms and fellowship activities.\nIn March, 1997, the Parish Hall plan was presented to the Congregation by the Building Committee.  It was accepted as a design that complemented the beautiful little church of Our Redeemer and its construction moved steadily onward.\n\n\nChancel furnishings given by Hamilton Rodgers Fairfax, 1896\n\n\n\nSanctuary lights given in memory of Mr. and Mrs. A.L.B. diZerega by their family.\n\n\n\nThe dark blue vaulted ceilings with walnut trusses denote the heavens; \nthe wall color denotes the air; the carpet color denotes the earth.  The\nstained glass windows speak of Our Redeemer’s links to its past and\nfuture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLucy Berkeley Moore\n  Memorial Stained\n   Glass Window	\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnston Russell\nMemorial Stained\n   Glass Window	\n\n\n\nEveryone worked hard, dreamed and prayed for a building that is crucial to Redeemer’s future.  At every turn, on every hand, there seemed to be a Guardian Angel who helped Our Redeemer reach its goals.(After 110 years, could Henry Fairfax still be watching after the little church he’d built on the corner of his land?)\n\nThat those goals have been reached so quickly is almost a miracle in itself.  The Congregation believes it is blest, that God has been extremely good to us, that in the future we must continue to be His responsible stewards.\n\nRedeemer is on its way.  And one thing is certain:  Not one word has been left out of its current vestry and congregational reports; not one picture has been left un-taken.  When the next history of Redeemer is needed, it can be taken from the Internet!\n\n		\nA Note from the Author\n\nWhen I was asked by the Dedication Committee to prepare a small treatise on the history of Church of Our Redeemer, to be readied in a month’s time, it seemed simple to say “oh yes, I’d  like to do that.” After digging through every note and record I could find on Redeemer’s earliest years it is hereby highly recommended that Chet (Chester) Low’s excellent historical essay, written or the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the consecration of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Middleburg, be diligently read and studied.\n\nChet Low readily acknowledged that he had relied heavily on the already researched work by Loudoun historian Eugene Scheel, The History of Middleburg and Vicinity, for answers about his questions about John Parish, in particular, and the role of the Episcopal \nChurch in this area, in general, since 1843 when its ministry truly began outside Tidewater Virginia.\nIt is recommended that Scheel’s book also be studied by those interested in Loudoun-Fauquier history.  Between these two printed materials and the hand-written church records of Emmanuel and Our Redeemer churches we have an idea of how Redeemer came about --- and why we know it as the wonderful little church we love today.\n\n							Alworthy U.

The kneelers at the Altar rail were specially designed by Mrs. \nSharp to denote the little white church as a part of this rural countryside and its relationship to Oak Hill.  They \nare dedicated to the ministers, vestries, Altar Guilds, and organists who have served Our Redeemer.\n                \n Needlepoint cushions on the priest chairs were dedicated in 1997 in honor of the Rev. S. Neale Morgan.						\n\nThe Our Redeemer Kneeler at the Communion rail.\n\nTrees and Plantings\n The landscape for the new parish hall was designed by parishioner Lizbeth Prins.  Many of the trees and shrubs were donated in memory of or in honor of a loved one, or cherished friend.\n A Friendship Garden will be a special feature of the new landscaping for the Church and Parish Hall.  A knot garden, designed by Lizbeth Prins, will feature rows of boxwood, in keeping with the older boxwood and perennial plantings.\n A crabapple tree and a barberry hedge given by the Tyler family and an apple tree planted for Our Redeemer by Bishop John Baden are among the horticultural treasures of the church.\n\nAltar Linens, Hangings, Hymnals and Prayer Books\n\nAltar Linens and hangings have been lovingly made by hand and given in memory of Our Redeemer communicants.  The hymnals and prayer books are all gifts to the Church.\n\n\nOther Gifts\n\n	 One very hot summer, John Wallace put air conditioning in the church.  One Christmas, the Snyders gave colonial hurricane lamps to decorate the windows.  Interim rector Ted Johnson left Altar copies of the Gospel and Book of Common Prayer as gifts.\n	The beautiful patio appeared as if by magic.  The sign, the parking lot, the outdoor lighting, garden benches and a table, a library and whatever Our Redeemer needs just seems to come!\n\nParish Hall\n	The tradition of giving continues with the completion and September 26, 1999 dedication of the Parish Hall---what more can we ask.', 'Our History', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '243-autosave', '', '', '2010-10-25 13:08:49', '2010-10-25 18:08:49', '', 243, 'http://doverknoll.com/aldiechurch/archives/268', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Amen.\r\n\r\nGenesis 32:22-31\r\n\r\nThat night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 23 After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. 24 So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. 25 When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob''s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. 26 Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me." 27 The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered. 28 Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome." 29 Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there. 30 So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared." 31 The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.\r\n\r\nPsalm 121\r\n\r\n1 I lift up my eyes to the hills; * from where is my help to come? 2 My help comes from the Lord, * the maker of heaven and earth. 3 He will not let your foot be moved * and he who watches over you will not fall asleep. 4 Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel * shall neither slumber nor sleep; 5 The Lord himself watches over you; * the Lord is your shade at your right hand, 6 So that the sun shall not strike you by day, * nor the moon by night. 7 The Lord shall preserve you from all evil; * it is he who shall keep you safe. 8 The Lord shall watch over your going out and    your coming in, * from this time forth for evermore.\r\n\r\n2 Timothy 3:14-4:5\r\n\r\nBut as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, 15 and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17 so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. 4:1 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: 2 Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction. 3 For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. 5 But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.\r\n\r\nLuke 18:1-8\r\n\r\nThen Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. 2 He said: "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men. 3 And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ''Grant me justice against my adversary.'' 4 "For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ''Even though I don''t fear God or care about men, 5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won''t eventually wear me out with her coming!'' " 6 And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says. 7 And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? 8 I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly.

If you are concerned about catching anything, you needn''t - our priest uses rubbing alcohol to clean his hands before serving, and the vessels are thoroughly washed after every service.  Finally, if you would prefer, a separate cup for continction (dipping) is available.\r\n\r\n<em><em>So, what is communion?</em></em> If you were observing it like an anthropologist, this is what you''d see:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The Priest pours a cup of wine and prays over a piece of bread.</li>\r\n	<li>Everybody in the church will get out of their seats (by rows), and stand in line until there is space available to kneel at the altar.</li>\r\n	<li>When you get to the altar, if you do NOT want to take the elements, simply cross your hands over your chest, and the priest will give you a blessing.

One can either eat the bread or wait until the cup comes and dip it.</li>\r\n	<li>The cup of wine is then brought, and you either take a sip or dip your bread.</li>\r\n	<li>People then return to their seat.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIt''s not that scary.

Basically we figure you''re an adult, and know that this is a solemn ceremony memorializing the sacrifice that Jesus made on our behalf. For that reason, both we and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:27-29&amp;version=NLT">Scripture</a> suggest you not take it lightly, but we do encourage <em>all</em> baptised Christians (regardless of denomination) to join.  Typically, we suggest that younger children should be confirmed (usually around the age of 11 or 12) before actually taking the elements, but again, we trust you to make that decision.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason you are not comfortable taking communion, please come forward anyway to receive a blessing. If you are concerned about catching anything, you needn''t - our priest uses rubbing alcohol to clean his hands before serving, and the vessels are thoroughly washed after every service.  Finally, if you would prefer, a separate cup for continction (dipping) is available.\r\n\r\n<em><em>So, what is communion?</em></em> If you were observing it like an anthropologist, this is what you''d see:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The Priest pours a cup of wine and prays over a piece of bread.</li>\r\n	<li>Everybody in the church will get out of their seats (by rows), and stand in line until there is space available to kneel at the altar.</li>\r\n	<li>When you get to the altar, if you do NOT want to take the elements, simply cross your hands over your chest, and the priest will give you a blessing. You can simply leave at this point.</li>\r\n	<li>Those receiving communion will hold their hand out for the bread, which the priest will place on the hand. One can either eat the bread or wait until the cup comes and dip it.</li>\r\n	<li>The cup of wine is then brought, and you either take a sip or dip your bread.</li>\r\n	<li>People then return to their seat.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIt''s not that scary. What is happening, however, is that we are playing out the "Last Supper," the last passover which Jesus celebrated, the night before he was sentenced to death on the cross. While the ceremony he was celebrating remembered the Israelites being rescued from Egypt even as the Egyptians were being killed, Jesus used the ceremony to show that he was rescuing his followers from Sin, and would die in the process.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more, please contact our rector', 'How do you do communion?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '79-revision-3', '', '', '2010-09-23 16:01:02', '2010-09-23 16:01:02', '', 79, 'http://doverknoll.com/aldiechurch/archives/213', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(243, 1, '2010-09-26 12:15:23', '2010-09-26 12:15:23', '\r\n<h1>A Small History of the Church of Our Redeemer</h1>\r\n Aldie, Virginia\r\n\r\n In 1850 the Aldie Episcopalians, who previously had been Members of the Cameron and Shelbourne Parishes, separated from them and joined Meade Parish.  In 1853 Meade Parish was divided into two parts.  The eastern half was organized as Johns Parish, taking its name from the Reverend John Johns, the 4th bishop of Virginia.  The new parish included the towns of Upperville, Middleburg and Aldie with the rectory located in Upperville.\r\n\r\n In 1885 the parish was again reorganized, excluding Upperville but including Oatlands. In 1945 Johns Parish was to consist of Middleburg’s Emmanuel and Aldie’s Church of Our Redeemer. Oatlands became an independent church.\r\n\r\n There was no Episcopal church Building in Aldie before 1890, and services had been held in the Union Church on the site of today’s Presbyterian Church.  In 1849, that town lot and the building erected thereon were transferred to trustees, John Moore, Thomas Boyle, Robert Ish and William Rawlings for these purposes:  the building to be used as a place of public worship free to Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians, and the lot to be appropriated for and used exclusively as a graveyard.\r\n \r\n While there are no plans and pictures of the original building, it is believed to have been built of brick (probably burned on site) in the same style and possibly of the same size as historic Mt. Zion Church just east of Aldie on Route 50.  The free Church, located, naturally on Aldie’s Meeting House Lane, was sold to the trustees of the Presbyterian Church for the sum of five dollars in 1892.  By then the other denominations had built and moved into churches of their own.					\r\n\r\n It was during this time that vestry records of Redeemer were sparsely kept, and indeed, the church was not known as Our Redeemer until it was so named in 1890.  Parishioner Henry Fairfax then owner of Oak Hill, the former estate of President James Monroe who retired to Loudoun County after his White House years, decided that Aldie needed an Episcopal church for its congregation from that village and nearby areas.  Mr. Fairfax and his neighbors, though already pew-holders and contributors at Emmanuel, would build one.\r\n\r\n The word was long handed down that the church was built entirely at Mr. Fairfax’s expense, and possibly so, but we know that his brother, Hamilton Rogers Fairfax of New York donated the pine and walnut pews, also the chancel furniture including the pulpit and lectern, that Vestryman John  Moore had installed the lovely stained glass window above the altar as a memorial to his wife Lucy Berkeley Moore, and that many of the other church furnishings were placed there by the Moore and diZerega families who figured largely in Redeemer’s early history.  However else the little white clapboard church came about, we know that Henry Fairfax deeded a plot of land on the southwest corner of his Oak Hill property fronting on the Little River Turnpike to Johns Parish and the Church of Our Redeemer came into existence.  We have only one pinpoint to its building date.  In the “Enterprise” column of the Loudoun Mirror, an early Loudoun County newspaper was found this item: \r\n\r\nALDIE VA., June 24, 1890.  “Our Episcopal friends have recently completed a very neat church in Aldie and expect to open it for service early in July.”\r\n\r\n The columnist known only as “Observer” also mentioned that the Little River Baptist Church would be dedicated the next Sunday, holding services all the day and the Saturday before.\r\n\r\n In the style of the time, Our Redeemer sat firmly on its stone foundation, its steep roof cover a 30’ by 47’ rectangular sanctuary with ribbed vaulted ceiling.  The interior, narthex doors, and windows followed a much-modified gothic design, all so simple as to warrant its being “a small country church” which, indeed, it has been ever since, despite its somewhat elegant furnishings.  While the building itself reflects the area, the furnishings reflect the Victorian era in which it was built.  Brass, carved walnut, cut glass, ornate silver and a marble font are still being enhanced by stained glass and needlepoint.\r\n\r\n When the new Parish House was being designed in 1997, the most important feature to the congregation was that it be architecturally compatible with the present church building, keeping the Moore window completely intact.  That this was done warrants tribute not only to today’s planners and builders but to the tastes and talents of our founding fathers.\r\n\r\n In its earliest days, whether Johns Parish Episcopalians met for worship in the free churches of Aldie or Middleburg, at Emmanuel, or finally at Our Redeemer, they followed the low- church ritual.  Because of their life-styles---farmers, millers, a few statesmen, wheelwrights, or small businessmen, --- the vestries chose not to stress those high-church traditions of more sophisticated parishes.  It was not until the early nineteen seventies that low-church ritual at Our Redeemer began subtly changing.  New prayer books, even new hymnals, the open-mindedness of bishops and the willingness of our ministers and congregations to accept change paved the way toward a more ecumenical attitude, thus more formal ritual.\r\n\r\n In the forties, except for kneeling to pray and following the prayer book, the service at Our Redeemer was the same as in any other Aldie church.  In fact, the only Sunday school in town was at the Presbyterian Church and some Episcopal members went there at 10:30 after 9:30 Redeemer services.  With change from low- church happening so slowly, it was easy to accept the processional cross, elevation of elements, and assistance of lay people---all things that make up our present service.  Learning to follow the newly styled bulletin and to sing the canticles in the new hymnal was much more difficult!\r\n	\r\n Some other changes in our times:  Until the seventies no woman had ever served on the vestry.  During the Rev. Neale Morgan’s tenure as pastor, a number of Our Redeemer women members were elected to that august office, and many have followed.  Helen Wallace served as the first woman Senior Warden, and Worthy Caulk as the first woman Junior Warden of Our Redeemer.\r\n	\r\n Through the years, a woman of the church were always the church organists, but since 1992 a man, John Gardecki, has taken his place at the console of our present pipe organ, given to the church by Deborah Kaylor in memory of her grandfathers, both musicians in the nineteenth century.  Redeemer has been blessed with ministers who could sing while the congregation joined in because it was a good and joyful thing to do.  Today a finely outfitted choir joins the dedicated organist in making music come alive in the church.\r\n	\r\n The history of Redeemer’s Sunday school goes back to its church beginnings when the children from the Oak Hill vicinity were driven across the fields in a pony cart by the Fairfax’s English governess, Redeemer’s first Sunday school teacher, to be met there by other children of the village.\r\n	\r\n There were years, however, when services were sparsely attended, and Sunday school not at all.  In 1950 came the request from the Women’s Auxiliary (church ladies were known as such then) that Our Redeemer have an all-purpose room suitable for Sunday school, meetings, suppers and bible school.  It was built—and a bank loan for it was paid back fully with a minimum of sacrifice but maximum effort.\r\n\r\n Vestrymen and village friends with know-how were resident engineers, contractors, and bankers.  The women of the church helped plan the moneymaking events:  Aldie old homes tours complete with plantation luncheon at Stoke, antique sales at Mercer and Berkeley houses, and the Church’s own harvest festival.  By this time the women had become more than church housekeepers and gardeners, supper organizers and Sunday school teachers. The all purpose room, constructed beneath the original church building, added 1000 ft of usable space at a cost of $8,086.31.\r\n\r\n Mrs. Henry Fairfax long outlived her husband who had been Our Redeemer’s guardian angel until his death in 1916.  For most of her years Eugenia Tennant Fairfax was a source of any information on Our Redeemer.  We quote as we remember: “Mr. Fairfax gave the land; the money for building the Episcopal Church was raised entirely by Mr. Fairfax and Captain diZerega who lived in the Mercer house.  Mr. Norris was the architect and Mr. Ambler was the builder, along with Mr. Watson.”  There was no mention anywhere of cost.  Mrs. Fairfax did say, however, that when church money was needed for any purpose, it came from the collection plates or from the goodness of parishioners’ hearts.  Pass the hat, as it were.\r\n  	\r\n From the Resolution of Memoriam by the vestry on his death: “the Hon. Henry Fairfax was a man prominent in the affairs of State and Nation but not withstanding the wide range of his interests…he kept alive an active interest in his home county and his church…always ready to do his part which would be helpful in the moral and spiritual betterment of the community in which he lived.”\r\n	\r\n Our Redeemer was very lucky to have been on the receiving end of the devotion of Henry and “Miss Eugie” Fairfax. After they purchased and moved to the old Rogers plantation west of Aldie, named “Oakham”, where Mr. Fairfax raised champion trotting horses, Oak Hill plantation passed into the hands of Mr. Frank Littleton.  It was then purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas DeLashmutt.   In1956 the DeLashmutt’s deeded land for a parking lot around Redeemer which was enlarged by yet a third gift of land from Oak Hill in 1997 when current owners, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas DeLashmutt,  Jr. donated enough acreage to more than double the parking space needed for the Parish Hall project begun in March of that year.\r\n	\r\n It is a notable fact that most of the rectors and vestries kept excellent parishioner records during the early years of Johns Parish, and before, from 1840-1853 in Meade Parish by the Reverends Slaughter, Jackson, and Wilmer.  The notes of Johns Parish were furnished intact until 1889 by the Reverends Kinsolving, Dame, Maury, Johnson, Johns and Ambler, giving names and dates for those Episcopalians who were born, baptized, confirmed, communicants, married and buried in the Parish, listed as either Middleburg or Aldie members.\r\n	\r\n Middleburg had built its own church in 1843, another “very neat and convenient” brick church given the Hebrew name of “Immanuel” according to Bishop John Johns who consecrated it.\r\n	\r\n Emmanuel also built a rectory on a near-by lot but they rented it out as a residence rather than using it themselves because the rectors who served the three charges of Middleburg, Aldie and Oatlands preferred to live halfway between them.  Aldie was chosen despite the leaking roof that had come with the former Mt. Zion Baptist rectory purchased by the Episcopalians.\r\n	\r\n The Aldie rectory was the meeting place of the combined vestries, as we have noted, but otherwise there is no telling what happened at those meetings.  Regardless of the beautiful penmanship in which the minutes were written, most of them are impossible.\r\n\r\n  It is believed, however, that excepting costs and payments --- distributions thereof ---electing vestrymen (many of whom served for years at a time), writing resolutions of appreciation and voting on the property repairs (eternally ongoing) plus electing representatives to various church conventions, nothing much of interest came about.  Though, while laboriously proceeding through vestry records from 1853-1921, many items of value did emerge.  In some instances these items were copied without reserve from the Rev. Richard H. Wilmer (1849-1852) who found no register upon taking charge of Meade Parish and merely recorded such facts in relation to the Parish prior to his rector ship as he has been able to glean from others.  One hundred and fifty years later this “small history” gatherer understands that perfectly.\r\n	\r\n  In 1853-1870, while the Rev. Kinsolving was in charge, Johns Parish was organized.  A Civil War had also raged through the land.  Births and deaths of those at home had been recorded.  We know that Aldie’s Free Church had become a hospital as had many homes of communicants who lived near area battlefields.  Dover and Aldie Mills were among the grist mills along Little River, which, used to grinding grain for neighboring farmers, turned to furnishing food for the Confederate, and in many instances, the Union Army.  Young sons of the Parish went off to war; the Rev. Kinsolving himself was taken to prison --- perhaps because of earlier secession sermons.\r\n	\r\n  Aldie became known as “a hornet’s hive.”  General J.E.B. Stuart, Col. John Mosby, and Aldie vestryman William N. Noland who formed Champe Rifles, all became Turnpike heroes. But there was no mention of the Civil War in the minutes of the vestry of either church.  There was few worship services held during the war.  The vestries did duly meet at the Aldie directory, usually on Sunday afternoons, but only to elect new members or reinstall old ones.  After 1865 the Aldie Episcopalians continued their worship at the Free Church in Middleburg which still welcomes them to its homecoming each year on the second Sunday in June.\r\n	\r\n  In 1877, then Rector William Johnson pleaded with the vestries to give consideration to his ideas of having communicants make an annual pledge to the church which they could pay through monthly installments put into the Sunday collection plates.  They did --- and we still do.   Pledge Sunday is the first Sunday in November.\r\n	\r\n  So---very little that we can see from the records happened in Johns Parish from the period following the Civil --- or War Between the States --- until 1903 when the Rev. Thomas C. Darst took charge of Johns Parish.  He wrote, “There was no evidence to show that the minutes of form in Aldie Vestry Meetings had been recorded.”\r\n	\r\n  During that cut-off period of information one very important thing did happen, however.  The Church of Our Redeemer was built and in 1903 the following vestry was elected: Henry Fairfax, John D. Moore, Littleton Turner, J. Thomas Watson, Edward Wilson, Parker Wilson, Alfred L. B. diZerega joined the vestry the following year.  The entire membership was of Aldie residents joining the long list of Aldie names like Berkeley, Adams, McVeigh, Noland, Oden, Carter, Harris --- who since the beginning had been part of Aldie’s church.  Goode, Tyler, Hutchison…\r\n	\r\n  From then on the Redeemer records are complete, although factually spare in some years: During World War I there were only quarterly vestry meetings; during World War II funds were at such a low ebb it was difficult to keep up necessary payments; vestries cut back on all but war-time emergencies. Parishioners and their personal church records are duly noted, (housed now in our new Parish House library.)  Many family names have been added through the years while many more have sadly been subtracted.\r\n	\r\n  Aldie remained a small rural town, its residents involved mainly in farming, milling, carriage and wagon building and store-keeping until not too many years ago when Route 50 allowed for better transportation into the government centers in Washington.  The Mercer-planned canal from Alexandria to Aldie did not ever get built, but Charles Fenton Mercer who founded the village left many good reminders of his life in his corner of Virginia when he was legislator and U.S. Congressman, a pusher for roads and free education.  As his village and its environment grows and changes, so does the Church of Our Redeemer.\r\n	\r\n  In 1995 there came the biggest change of all.  The Churches of Johns Parish became unyoked, each going its separate way in its ministry while remaining a part of the same parish.  Until then Emmanuel and Our Redeemer had shared the same rector --- and there must be a word here about some of those who since 1921 have pastured Aldie’s flock.\r\n	\r\n  The Rev. David Campbell Mayers --- lived in Aldie’s Rectory and was a pillar of the entire community, even joining with his wife in 1923 the Aldie Horticultural Society, founded to beautify the village, to interest school children in horticulture and to grow bulbs for sale in city markets.  Rev. Mayers was a legend in his twenty-five year stint with Episcopalians of Aldie and Middleburg.\r\n	\r\n  As was the Rev. Ernest (Froggy) de Bordenave, 1955-1967, who goes down in our history as exceptionally well-loved.  An astute businessman (“He knew everybody so could talk anyone into lending us their house for Aldie’s Old Homes Tours.”)  He was highly respected as a town leader, and believer in equal rights between the races.  Froggy’s fearless stance on integration is one of our Parish’s proudest memories.\r\n												\r\n  S. Neale Morgan followed Froggy in his public spiritedness and support of justice for all.  During his years in Middleburg and Aldie (he first lived in the Rectory in Middleburg, then he and his wife Mary Ann built their own home in Aldie.) and the FISH organization --- a volunteer effort to buy and deliver food for the needy, help pay medical and utility bills and to drive those who need it to medical facilities.  Redeemer is active with FISH and it remains on the church list of outreach supports.  For another twenty-five years the Rev. Morgan was among us --- his sermons were superb.  He brought in ordained women as his assistants, and he brought about many other changes --- but so quietly one would never guess!\r\n	\r\n  Outreach funds come from one of the two Parish jointly supported activities of long-standing.  The Rummage Sale is held in May; its funds are contributed to various places that need financial help including Seven Loaves, Abused Women’s Shelter, the Aldie Fire Department, and the Bishops Fund for World Relief, etc.  The Christmas Shop will celebrate its 50th year in November, 1999.  It has grown in leaps and bounds through the boundless energy of the women of Johns Parish, and more recently, its men.  Funds from the Christmas Shop are divided among the two churches; they are shared with the Diocese, Charities, Episcopal missions overseas, and ecumenical outreach of the National Church.\r\n	\r\n  Our Redeemer’s own fundraiser - the Shrove Tuesday’s pancake supper help relieve the burden of the church treasury. Not for funds but for fun --- we have the Blessing of the Pets in October, and the Parish Picnic in August.\r\n\r\nA small history cannot be complete without a calendar of events.\r\n	The Event celebrated in 1999 is the completion of the Parish House.  In 1995 it was the unyoking of the churches and Redeemer’s call to its very first own priest-in-large.  The Rev. Jane Wallace Barr accepted that call.  She is now our three-quarter time priest.\r\n	In a focus statement written by the vestry in 1995,m this family-sized multi-generational congregation had a vision:\r\n•	To expand the congregation’s size and to increase the number and variety of programs for worship, study and fellowship for children and adults.\r\n•	To rely to a greater extent on pledges to pay operational costs, devoting fund raising proceeds to outreach.\r\n•	More hands-on Congregational participation.\r\n•	To have a full-time Priest.\r\n•	To be a light in the community, providing a place of faith and fellowship for all.\r\n•	To promote spiritual growth and rejuvenation.\r\n•	To be a place where the Gospel is preached, and God glorified through the Savior, Jesus Christ.\r\n•	To build a Parish Hall to provide space for an office, Sunday School classrooms and fellowship activities.\r\nIn March, 1997, the Parish Hall plan was presented to the Congregation by the Building Committee.  It was accepted as a design that complemented the beautiful little church of Our Redeemer and its construction moved steadily onward.\r\n\r\n\r\nChancel furnishings given by Hamilton Rodgers Fairfax, 1896\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSanctuary lights given in memory of Mr. and Mrs. A.L.B. diZerega by their family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dark blue vaulted ceilings with walnut trusses denote the heavens; \r\nthe wall color denotes the air; the carpet color denotes the earth.  The\r\nstained glass windows speak of Our Redeemer’s links to its past and\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy Berkeley Moore\r\n  Memorial Stained\r\n   Glass Window	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnston Russell\r\nMemorial Stained\r\n   Glass Window	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone worked hard, dreamed and prayed for a building that is crucial to Redeemer’s future.  At every turn, on every hand, there seemed to be a Guardian Angel who helped Our Redeemer reach its goals.(After 110 years, could Henry Fairfax still be watching after the little church he’d built on the corner of his land?)\r\n\r\nThat those goals have been reached so quickly is almost a miracle in itself.  The Congregation believes it is blest, that God has been extremely good to us, that in the future we must continue to be His responsible stewards.\r\n\r\nRedeemer is on its way.  And one thing is certain:  Not one word has been left out of its current vestry and congregational reports; not one picture has been left un-taken.  When the next history of Redeemer is needed, it can be taken from the Internet!\r\n\r\n		\r\nA Note from the Author\r\n\r\nWhen I was asked by the Dedication Committee to prepare a small treatise on the history of Church of Our Redeemer, to be readied in a month’s time, it seemed simple to say “oh yes, I’d  like to do that.” After digging through every note and record I could find on Redeemer’s earliest years it is hereby highly recommended that Chet (Chester) Low’s excellent historical essay, written or the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the consecration of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Middleburg, be diligently read and studied.\r\n\r\nChet Low readily acknowledged that he had relied heavily on the already researched work by Loudoun historian Eugene Scheel, The History of Middleburg and Vicinity, for answers about his questions about John Parish, in particular, and the role of the Episcopal \r\nChurch in this area, in general, since 1843 when its ministry truly began outside Tidewater Virginia.\r\nIt is recommended that Scheel’s book also be studied by those interested in Loudoun-Fauquier history.  Between these two printed materials and the hand-written church records of Emmanuel and Our Redeemer churches we have an idea of how Redeemer came about --- and why we know it as the wonderful little church we love today.\r\n\r\n							Alworthy U.

One Christmas, the Snyders gave colonial hurricane lamps to decorate the windows.  Interim rector Ted Johnson left Altar copies of the Gospel and Book of Common Prayer as gifts.\r\n	The beautiful patio appeared as if by magic.

(Genesis 1:1;  John 3:16)\r\n\r\nWe believe God the Son is Jesus of Nazareth, the Savior sent by God,  Israel’s Messiah, born of a virgin, fully man and fully God. (Mat 1:18;  Philippians\r\n2:6; Hebrews 4:15; Romans 8:3)\r\n\r\nWe believe God the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, quickens us from death  to life, indwells all those who receive Jesus Christ by faith as Lord  and Savior and continuously conforms believers to the image of Jesus  Christ.

(250, 1, '2008-02-08 21:46:27', '2008-02-08 21:46:27', 'A sermon preached by the Rev. John Thomas Sheehan\r\nFebruary 17, 2008\r\n\r\n“What if you knew you only had 30 days to live?”  How would you change?\r\n\r\nAs I said last week – life is terminal – the question is not if it’s when.\r\n\r\nYet, it is easy for us to live as though we were going to be here  forever. We settle into a routine of fast paced living.  We give little  thought to where we are going or what direction we are headed.  All we  know is that we are going fast and we can’t seem to get off the  treadmill.\r\n\r\nClearly this is not something new.  James (the brother of Jesus)  writes: “And now I have a word for those who brashly announce, ‘Today –  at the latest, tomorrow – we’re off to such and such a city for the  year...”  You don’t know the first thing about tomorrow.  You’re but a  wisp of fog, catching a brief bit of sun before disappearing.  Instead,  make it a habit to say, “If the Lord wills it and we’re still alive,  we’ll do this or that.’”(4:14-15 The Message)\r\n\r\nAgainst the backdrop of eternity, even if you live 80, 90, or 100  years, your life is still just a vapor that quickly vanishes.  The only  thing we know for sure is that we have today.\r\n\r\nSo, on this day we’re going to focus on just one line from the song,  “Live Like You Were Dying” that line that talks about is to “speaking  more sweetly.”\r\n\r\nOur words have power – the power lift up and encourage and the power  to tear down and destroy.  So the Lord’s the gift of “voice” is an  amazing and powerful gift.  Voice allows us, to express our deepest  thoughts and emotions.  In Genesis we are told that God used words in  creation: “And God said. Let there be ... and there was ...” John  writes, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and  the Word was God”  Jesus is the Word, John continues by saying that,   “In the Word (in Jesus) was life, and the life was the light of men.”   In the past God spoke through the prophets – today He has spoken through  and by his son.  The most powerful communication of God to mankind came  in the form of Jesus.  He is the ultimate and complete Word from God.\r\n\r\nSome here today could give testimony to the power of hurtful words.   You still remember word for word a verbal lashing you received from a  parent or a teacher or a coach or a spouse.  It may have happened years  ago, but even in this moment you can feel the emotion of embarrassment,  shame or anger.  Verbal shrapnel has left scars on all of us.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of you know the power of affirming words.   You have experienced the joy of someone’s verbal blessing.  Words have  inspired you, comforted you, and challenged you.  You know what it’s  like for someone to look you in the eye and say “I believe in you…You  can do it!”\r\n\r\nHere are three ways to use your words so that they are life giving.   If you only had 30 days to live, I am convinced these three suggestions  would be changes you would want to make.\r\n\r\nAppreciate people\r\n\r\nIn Colossians Paul challenges us to “Let your lives overflow with thanksgiving for all he has done.” (2:7 NLT)\r\n\r\nOne of the defining characteristic of a Christian is an attitude of gratitude.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy for our words to be more about grumbling than about gratitude.  This is a struggle as old as the human race.\r\n\r\nWhen God created Adam and Eve he put them in the Garden of Eden  (paradise).   It was perfect in every way.  Everything was provided for  their enjoyment.  God only withheld one thing from them; one tree in the  middle of the garden.  Rather than gratitude for what they had, they  were tempted to grumbling about what they couldn’t have.\r\n\r\nBefore we throw stones at Adam and Eve, we need to look at our  hearts.  Compared to the most of the world – we are ultra rich.  And  rather than being grateful for what we have – we tend to be preoccupied  with what we don’t have.\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict considered grumbling a serious offense against community  life.  He writes, “First and foremost, there must be no word or sign of  grumbling, no manifestation of it for any reason at all.”  The most  wonderful line in Benedict’s rule describes the appropriate response to a  monk who was creating discord by their grumbling.  “Let Father Abbot  send two stout monks to explain the matter to him.”  You complain and  whine in the monastery and you get a visit from a couple of monks named  Louie and Guido.  Hmm – this might be a good strategy for the church.\r\nSome of you are thinking – come on John – “you don’t understand how hard  my life is.”   Sorry, you’re not off the hook.  Listen to what Paul  writes.\r\n\r\n“Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God''s will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.” (1 Thessalonians 5:18)\r\n\r\nDid you hear those first words?  No matter what happens – ALWAYS be  thankful.  No matter what you are going through; even if you only had 30  days left to live you can still be filled with gratitude.  First and  foremost if you know Jesus Christ as your savior, you have an eternal  life to be thankful for.  No matter what life throws at you, you are  loved.  You are forgiven.  You have hope.  You are at peace with God.   So, you can face death without fear.\r\n\r\nWhen is the last time you just said “thank you” to Jesus?\r\n\r\nThere is a fascinating story about gratitude in the book of Luke.\r\n\r\nIt happened as Jesus was on His was to Jerusalem.  As he entered a  village, ten men, all lepers, met Him.  Keeping their distance, they  raised their voices, calling out,“Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”  Taking a good look at them, Jesus said, “Go show yourselves to the  priests.” They went, and while they were still on their way, they became  clean.  One of them, when he realized that he was healed, turned and  came back, shouting his gratitude, glorifying God.  He was so grateful,  he fell at Jesus'' feet.  He couldn’t thank him enough.  This man was a  Samaritan.  Jesus said, “Didn''t I heal ten men?  Where are the other  nine?  Can none be found to come back and give glory to God except this  outsider?” (Luke 17:12-18)\r\n\r\nTen lepers miraculously healed.  And only one takes the time to come  back and say “thanks.”  Unbelievable!  I love this one guy.  He comes  back – shouting “Praise God I’m healed.”  Then he falls at Jesus’ feet  and says “thank you… thank you… thank you… thank you.”\r\n\r\nWhen people realize that they have been touched by God and their  hearts are filled with gratitude, you know what happens?   Their face  gets involved and they smile more.  Then their mouth gets involved and  they shout-out their gratitude.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of ways to put this into practice.\r\n\r\nStop and say “thanks” to people who serve you\r\n\r\nLife around here moves pretty fast.  If we’re not careful, we can  miss opportunities for gratitude to fill our soul and roll off of our  lips.   So, I want you to focus on noticing the small things.  Then,  every chance you get, say “thank you.”\r\n\r\nWhen you pass the crossing guard at the school roll down your window  as you go by and say, “Thanks for what you do.”  When you see a solider,  stop and just say, “Thanks, I appreciate your service.”\r\n\r\nWhen you see the waitress, bank teller, nurse, Sunday school teacher, develop the habit of expressing thanks.\r\n\r\nSay “thanks” to the people who shaped you\r\n\r\nThere are people who shaped you, blessed you, or sacrificed for you.   If you only had 30 days to live, I bet you’d track them down and take  the time to tell them what they mean to you.\r\n\r\nWho’s coming to mind?  It maybe someone you haven’t seen in years.   But, they helped make you the person you are today.  Go to them – look  them in the eye and say, “Thanks, I am so grateful for your impact on my  life.”   I know this is new territory for some of you, but life is too  short and we aren’t promised tomorrow.  So, don’t miss this chance to  express your gratitude.\r\n\r\nEncourage people… build them up\r\n\r\nThis is huge and it is so simple to do.  In 1st  Thessalonians we are  given this challenge.  “So encourage each other and build each other  up, just as you are already doing.”(5:11)\r\n\r\nMother Teresa said, “Kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are endless.”\r\n\r\nOne day as Jesus was teaching in the synagogue – he saw a woman who  had been crippled and bent over and for 18 years – she was not able to  stand up straight.  Luke 13.\r\n\r\nJesus was moved with compassion.  So, he called to her, and he  reached out to touch her.  When he does, she is instantly healed.  She  stands up straight and begins praising God.  Yet, in the middle of all  the excitement and praise, the leader of the synagogue steps forward and  attacks Jesus for healing on the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus defends his actions, he calls her a “daughter of Abraham.”  I can almost see her walking home.  She is standing up straight.  She  feels ten feet tall.  She is seeing things she hasn’t seen in years.   And ringing in her ears are the life-giving words  “daughter of  Abraham.” .\r\n\r\nWe live in a world where people are beat up and put down.  We all  remember the saying, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words  will never hurt me.” Well, we know that’s not true. Do you remember Norm  from “Cheers”?  One day when he was asked how his day was, he  responded, “It’s a dog-eat-dog world and I’m wearing milk bone  underwear.”\r\n\r\nSome of you feel that way about this past week.  There are people all  around us who are stressed, anxious, fearful, angry, insecure or  discouraged.  They are everywhere.\r\n\r\nBut, here is the great news.  We have the unbelievable privilege of  looking people in the eye and saying to them, “You matter, your life  counts, God loves you, and God takes a personal interested in you.”\r\n\r\nHave you ever watched video footage from the Special Olympics.  I  love these clips.  As the kids compete, parents, friends and coaches  cheer wildly.   And as kids cross the finish line there is a mob of  hugging and cheering and celebrating.   It doesn’t matter how fast they  are or how gifted they are.  Every person is encouraged and cheered for  and celebrated.  If there is any group on earth that should demonstrate  this kind of encouragement, it is us – the body of Christ.\r\n\r\nWe should be excessive, obnoxious, and lavish with our encouragement.\r\n\r\nThere was a documentary about a woman who was facing significant  health issues.  When they asked her how she was managing to face the  challenges.  She led them upstairs to the master bathroom.\r\n\r\nShe simply pointed to the mirror. On the mirror were these words  written in lipstick by her young daughter.  “The best gift I could give  you is the gift to be able to see yourself as I see you.  You are my  hero.”\r\n\r\nProverbs 16:24 says, “Kind words are like honey – sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.”\r\n\r\nBefore we move on, I want to look at one more verse.\r\n\r\n“Encourage one another daily, as long as it’s called Today, so that  none of you may be hardened by sin''s deceitfulness.”  (Hebrews 3:13)\r\n\r\nThis is a great verse – it reminds us that all we really have is  today.  Our good intentions lead to many missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nI wonder how many people God put in my path this week.  But, missed  them, because I was so self-absorbed or moving to fast.  Jesus had this  wonderful capacity to “notice” people.  He never seemed to be rushed.   He never looked past them to someone more important.  He never seemed to  see people as an interruption or an annoyance.\r\n\r\nSo, how about it?  Who needs your encouragement?  Who could you bless this week with no strings attached?\r\nThere is one older gentleman I heard about that whenever he flies, he  picks up a few boxes of See’s candy.  And as he feels prompted and led,  he just gives them out to people as a way to encourage them.\r\n\r\nHowever, you choose to do it, let me challenge you to be a “blessing dispenser.”\r\n\r\nSo, we can appreciate people, encourage people and lastly, we can\r\n\r\nPray for people\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful privilege to be able to speak to people on behalf  of God.  But, it is an equal privilege to speak to God on behalf of  people.  In other words, we have the joy of carrying people and their  needs before the very presence of God.  We can prayer for our friends.\r\n\r\nThe Bible says that we can boldly go into his presence knowing that  he is a good Father who delights to meet the needs of his kids.  “So let  us boldly approach the throne of our gracious God with confidence – so  that we may receive  mercy and find grace to help us in our time of  need.” (Hebrews 4:16)\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful picture in the Old Testament that illustrates  this point.  It’s found in the book of Exodus.  It’s a picture of a  personal God who puts a premium on people.  In this passage, God builds  into the priestly duties the responsibility of carrying the people  before God.\r\n\r\n“Aaron will regularly carry the names of the sons of Israel, over his  heart, on the Breast-piece of Decision, as he enters the Sanctuary into  the presence of God. He will also put the Urim and the Thummim in the  breast-piece of decision.  So they may be over Aaron’s heart when he  enters the presence of the LORD God.  In this way Aaron will always  carry the Breast-piece of decision into the presence of God.” (Exodus  28:29-30)\r\n\r\nEvery time Aaron went to perform his priestly duties, he was reminded  of God’s heart for the people of Israel.  Each gem in the four rows of  stones represented a different tribe of Israel.  Every man, woman, boy  and girl was represented in those stones.  There wasn’t one person in  all of Israel that God didn’t love or care about.  It was Aaron’s job to  carry the people and their needs into the presence of the Lord.\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament, we learn that all of us who follow Jesus have  the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.  Like Aaron we carry our friends into  the presence of the Lord through prayer.\r\n\r\nAnd, here’s the good news.  You don’t have to go to the tabernacle  like Aaron.  You can go to the presence of God anytime, anywhere.  My  hope and prayer is that prayer becomes a lifestyle; an ongoing  conversation with God throughout the day.  While you are driving,  showering, taking a walk or sitting in front of your computer, you can  pray on behalf of the people that are in your heart.\r\n\r\nEphesians says, “Pray at all times.  Pray hard and long.  Pray for  your brothers and sisters.  Keep your eyes open.  Keep each other’s  spirits up so that no one falls behind.” (6:18)\r\n\r\nDid you hear that? Pray at all times (be persistent). Keep your eyes  open (Stay alert).  There is power in prayer.  Sometimes we minimize the  power of prayer and forget that prayer has the power to move heaven and  earth.\r\n\r\nJesus teaches in the Sermon on the Mount.\r\n\r\n“Keep on asking, and you will receive.  Keep on seeking, and you will  find.  Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.  For  everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone  who knocks, the door will be opened.  If your child ask for a loaf of  bread, do you give them a stone instead?  Or if they ask for a fish, do  you give them a snake?  Of course not!  So if you sinful people know how  to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in  heaven give good gifts to those who ask?” (Matthew 7:7-11)\r\n\r\nPrayer should be our first response not our last resort.  So, when  someone shares a need, a crisis, or praise, get in the habit of stopping  right then and there and praying.  People’s tears are often God’s  invitation to stop and pray.  Sometimes, the most important thing for  you to do is to pray on someone’s behalf.\r\n\r\nThe result is that people are encouraged, God’s power is unleashed,  and everyone’s faith is strengthened.  Can you imagine how it might  change our community and us if we just started praying for and with  people?  Can you imagine how it would impact people if we had no other  agenda than to bring their needs before God?  Let me challenge you give  it a try this coming week.  Make it your goal to pray with at least one  person that God brings your way. Take the risk. What do you have to  lose?  Go for it.\r\n\r\nI want to finish where we began. “Words kill, words give life.  They’re either poison or fruit – you chose.”(Proverbs 18:21)\r\n\r\nMay your words be life-giving this week.\r\n\r\n“May the Lord bless you and keep you; may the Lord make his face  shine upon you and be gracious to you, may the Lord turn his face toward  you and give you His peace.  May God’s gracious favor lead you to speak  sweeter this coming week.”', 'Live Like You''re Dying - 2.

(251, 1, '2010-09-27 21:46:17', '2010-09-27 21:46:17', 'A sermon preached by the Rev. John Thomas Sheehan\nFebruary 17, 2008\n\n“What if you knew you only had 30 days to live?”  How would you change?\n\nAs I said last week – life is terminal – the question is not if it’s when.\n\nYet, it is easy for us to live as though we were going to be here  forever. We settle into a routine of fast paced living.  We give little  thought to where we are going or what direction we are headed.  All we  know is that we are going fast and we can’t seem to get off the  treadmill.\n\nClearly this is not something new.  James (the brother of Jesus)  writes: “And now I have a word for those who brashly announce, ‘Today –  at the latest, tomorrow – we’re off to such and such a city for the  year...”  You don’t know the first thing about tomorrow.  You’re but a  wisp of fog, catching a brief bit of sun before disappearing.  Instead,  make it a habit to say, “If the Lord wills it and we’re still alive,  we’ll do this or that.’”(4:14-15 The Message)\n\nAgainst the backdrop of eternity, even if you live 80, 90, or 100  years, your life is still just a vapor that quickly vanishes.  The only  thing we know for sure is that we have today.\n\nSo, on this day we’re going to focus on just one line from the song,  “Live Like You Were Dying” that line that talks about is to “speaking  more sweetly.”\n\nOur words have power – the power lift up and encourage and the power  to tear down and destroy.  So the Lord’s the gift of “voice” is an  amazing and powerful gift.  Voice allows us, to express our deepest  thoughts and emotions.  In Genesis we are told that God used words in  creation: “And God said. Let there be ... and there was ...” John  writes, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and  the Word was God”  Jesus is the Word, John continues by saying that,   “In the Word (in Jesus) was life, and the life was the light of men.”   In the past God spoke through the prophets – today He has spoken through  and by his son.  The most powerful communication of God to mankind came  in the form of Jesus.  He is the ultimate and complete Word from God.\n\nSome here today could give testimony to the power of hurtful words.   You still remember word for word a verbal lashing you received from a  parent or a teacher or a coach or a spouse.  It may have happened years  ago, but even in this moment you can feel the emotion of embarrassment,  shame or anger.  Verbal shrapnel has left scars on all of us.\n\nOn the other hand, some of you know the power of affirming words.   You have experienced the joy of someone’s verbal blessing.  Words have  inspired you, comforted you, and challenged you.  You know what it’s  like for someone to look you in the eye and say “I believe in you…You  can do it!”\n\nHere are three ways to use your words so that they are life giving.   If you only had 30 days to live, I am convinced these three suggestions  would be changes you would want to make.\n\nAppreciate people\n\nIn Colossians Paul challenges us to “Let your lives overflow with thanksgiving for all he has done.” (2:7 NLT)\n\nOne of the defining characteristic of a Christian is an attitude of gratitude.\n\nIt’s easy for our words to be more about grumbling than about gratitude.  This is a struggle as old as the human race.\n\nWhen God created Adam and Eve he put them in the Garden of Eden  (paradise).   It was perfect in every way.  Everything was provided for  their enjoyment.  God only withheld one thing from them; one tree in the  middle of the garden.  Rather than gratitude for what they had, they  were tempted to grumbling about what they couldn’t have.\n\nBefore we throw stones at Adam and Eve, we need to look at our  hearts.  Compared to the most of the world – we are ultra rich.  And  rather than being grateful for what we have – we tend to be preoccupied  with what we don’t have.\n\nSt. Benedict considered grumbling a serious offense against community  life.  He writes, “First and foremost, there must be no word or sign of  grumbling, no manifestation of it for any reason at all.”  The most  wonderful line in Benedict’s rule describes the appropriate response to a  monk who was creating discord by their grumbling.  “Let Father Abbot  send two stout monks to explain the matter to him.”  You complain and  whine in the monastery and you get a visit from a couple of monks named  Louie and Guido.  Hmm – this might be a good strategy for the church.\nSome of you are thinking – come on John – “you don’t understand how hard  my life is.”   Sorry, you’re not off the hook.  Listen to what Paul  writes.\n\n“Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God''s will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.” (1 Thessalonians 5:18)\n\nDid you hear those first words?  No matter what happens – ALWAYS be  thankful.  No matter what you are going through; even if you only had 30  days left to live you can still be filled with gratitude.  First and  foremost if you know Jesus Christ as your savior, you have an eternal  life to be thankful for.  No matter what life throws at you, you are  loved.  You are forgiven.  You have hope.  You are at peace with God.   So, you can face death without fear.\n\nWhen is the last time you just said “thank you” to Jesus?\n\nThere is a fascinating story about gratitude in the book of Luke.\n\nIt happened as Jesus was on His was to Jerusalem.  As he entered a  village, ten men, all lepers, met Him.  Keeping their distance, they  raised their voices, calling out,“Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”  Taking a good look at them, Jesus said, “Go show yourselves to the  priests.” They went, and while they were still on their way, they became  clean.  One of them, when he realized that he was healed, turned and  came back, shouting his gratitude, glorifying God.  He was so grateful,  he fell at Jesus'' feet.  He couldn’t thank him enough.  This man was a  Samaritan.  Jesus said, “Didn''t I heal ten men?  Where are the other  nine?  Can none be found to come back and give glory to God except this  outsider?” (Luke 17:12-18)\n\nTen lepers miraculously healed.  And only one takes the time to come  back and say “thanks.”  Unbelievable!  I love this one guy.  He comes  back – shouting “Praise God I’m healed.”  Then he falls at Jesus’ feet  and says “thank you… thank you… thank you… thank you.”\n\nWhen people realize that they have been touched by God and their  hearts are filled with gratitude, you know what happens?   Their face  gets involved and they smile more.  Then their mouth gets involved and  they shout-out their gratitude.\n\nHere are a couple of ways to put this into practice.\n\nStop and say “thanks” to people who serve you\n\nLife around here moves pretty fast.  If we’re not careful, we can  miss opportunities for gratitude to fill our soul and roll off of our  lips.   So, I want you to focus on noticing the small things.  Then,  every chance you get, say “thank you.”\n\nWhen you pass the crossing guard at the school roll down your window  as you go by and say, “Thanks for what you do.”  When you see a solider,  stop and just say, “Thanks, I appreciate your service.”\n\nWhen you see the waitress, bank teller, nurse, Sunday school teacher, develop the habit of expressing thanks.\n\nSay “thanks” to the people who shaped you\n\nThere are people who shaped you, blessed you, or sacrificed for you.   If you only had 30 days to live, I bet you’d track them down and take  the time to tell them what they mean to you.\n\nWho’s coming to mind?  It maybe someone you haven’t seen in years.   But, they helped make you the person you are today.  Go to them – look  them in the eye and say, “Thanks, I am so grateful for your impact on my  life.”   I know this is new territory for some of you, but life is too  short and we aren’t promised tomorrow.  So, don’t miss this chance to  express your gratitude.\n\nEncourage people… build them up\n\nThis is huge and it is so simple to do.  In 1st  Thessalonians we are  given this challenge.  “So encourage each other and build each other  up, just as you are already doing.”(5:11)\n\nMother Teresa said, “Kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are endless.”\n\nOne day as Jesus was teaching in the synagogue – he saw a woman who  had been crippled and bent over and for 18 years – she was not able to  stand up straight.  Luke 13.\n\nJesus was moved with compassion.  So, he called to her, and he  reached out to touch her.  When he does, she is instantly healed.  She  stands up straight and begins praising God.  Yet, in the middle of all  the excitement and praise, the leader of the synagogue steps forward and  attacks Jesus for healing on the Sabbath.\n\nWhen Jesus defends his actions, he calls her a “daughter of Abraham.”  I can almost see her walking home.  She is standing up straight.  She  feels ten feet tall.  She is seeing things she hasn’t seen in years.   And ringing in her ears are the life-giving words  “daughter of  Abraham.” .\n\nWe live in a world where people are beat up and put down.  We all  remember the saying, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words  will never hurt me.” Well, we know that’s not true. Do you remember Norm  from “Cheers”?  One day when he was asked how his day was, he  responded, “It’s a dog-eat-dog world and I’m wearing milk bone  underwear.”\n\nSome of you feel that way about this past week.  There are people all  around us who are stressed, anxious, fearful, angry, insecure or  discouraged.  They are everywhere.\n\nBut, here is the great news.  We have the unbelievable privilege of  looking people in the eye and saying to them, “You matter, your life  counts, God loves you, and God takes a personal interested in you.”\n\nHave you ever watched video footage from the Special Olympics.  I  love these clips.  As the kids compete, parents, friends and coaches  cheer wildly.   And as kids cross the finish line there is a mob of  hugging and cheering and celebrating.   It doesn’t matter how fast they  are or how gifted they are.  Every person is encouraged and cheered for  and celebrated.  If there is any group on earth that should demonstrate  this kind of encouragement, it is us – the body of Christ.\n\nWe should be excessive, obnoxious, and lavish with our encouragement.\n\nThere was a documentary about a woman who was facing significant  health issues.  When they asked her how she was managing to face the  challenges.  She led them upstairs to the master bathroom.\n\nShe simply pointed to the mirror. On the mirror were these words  written in lipstick by her young daughter.  “The best gift I could give  you is the gift to be able to see yourself as I see you.  You are my  hero.”\n\nProverbs 16:24 says, “Kind words are like honey – sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.”\n\nBefore we move on, I want to look at one more verse.\n\n“Encourage one another daily, as long as it’s called Today, so that  none of you may be hardened by sin''s deceitfulness.”  (Hebrews 3:13)\n\nThis is a great verse – it reminds us that all we really have is  today.  Our good intentions lead to many missed opportunities.\n\nI wonder how many people God put in my path this week.  But, missed  them, because I was so self-absorbed or moving to fast.  Jesus had this  wonderful capacity to “notice” people.  He never seemed to be rushed.   He never looked past them to someone more important.  He never seemed to  see people as an interruption or an annoyance.\n\nSo, how about it?  Who needs your encouragement?  Who could you bless this week with no strings attached?\nThere is one older gentleman I heard about that whenever he flies, he  picks up a few boxes of See’s candy.  And as he feels prompted and led,  he just gives them out to people as a way to encourage them.\n\nHowever, you choose to do it, let me challenge you to be a “blessing dispenser.”\n\nSo, we can appreciate people, encourage people and lastly, we can\n\nPray for people\n\nIt is a wonderful privilege to be able to speak to people on behalf  of God.  But, it is an equal privilege to speak to God on behalf of  people.  In other words, we have the joy of carrying people and their  needs before the very presence of God.  We can prayer for our friends.\n\nThe Bible says that we can boldly go into his presence knowing that  he is a good Father who delights to meet the needs of his kids.  “So let  us boldly approach the throne of our gracious God with confidence – so  that we may receive  mercy and find grace to help us in our time of  need.” (Hebrews 4:16)\n\nThere is a beautiful picture in the Old Testament that illustrates  this point.

He comes  back – shouting “Praise God I’m healed.”  Then he falls at Jesus’ feet  and says “thank you… thank you… thank you… thank you.”\r\n\r\nWhen people realize that they have been touched by God and their  hearts are filled with gratitude, you know what happens?   Their face  gets involved and they smile more.  Then their mouth gets involved and  they shout-out their gratitude.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of ways to put this into practice.\r\n\r\nStop and say “thanks” to people who serve you\r\n\r\nLife around here moves pretty fast.  If we’re not careful, we can  miss opportunities for gratitude to fill our soul and roll off of our  lips.   So, I want you to focus on noticing the small things.  Then,  every chance you get, say “thank you.”\r\n\r\nWhen you pass the crossing guard at the school roll down your window  as you go by and say, “Thanks for what you do.”  When you see a solider,  stop and just say, “Thanks, I appreciate your service.”\r\n\r\nWhen you see the waitress, bank teller, nurse, Sunday school teacher, develop the habit of expressing thanks.\r\n\r\nSay “thanks” to the people who shaped you\r\n\r\nThere are people who shaped you, blessed you, or sacrificed for you.   If you only had 30 days to live, I bet you’d track them down and take  the time to tell them what they mean to you.\r\n\r\nWho’s coming to mind?  It maybe someone you haven’t seen in years.   But, they helped make you the person you are today.  Go to them – look  them in the eye and say, “Thanks, I am so grateful for your impact on my  life.”   I know this is new territory for some of you, but life is too  short and we aren’t promised tomorrow.  So, don’t miss this chance to  express your gratitude.\r\n\r\nEncourage people… build them up\r\n\r\nThis is huge and it is so simple to do.  In 1st  Thessalonians we are  given this challenge.  “So encourage each other and build each other  up, just as you are already doing.”(5:11)\r\n\r\nMother Teresa said, “Kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are endless.”\r\n\r\nOne day as Jesus was teaching in the synagogue – he saw a woman who  had been crippled and bent over and for 18 years – she was not able to  stand up straight.  Luke 13.\r\n\r\nJesus was moved with compassion.  So, he called to her, and he  reached out to touch her.  When he does, she is instantly healed.  She  stands up straight and begins praising God.  Yet, in the middle of all  the excitement and praise, the leader of the synagogue steps forward and  attacks Jesus for healing on the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus defends his actions, he calls her a “daughter of Abraham.”  I can almost see her walking home.  She is standing up straight.  She  feels ten feet tall.  She is seeing things she hasn’t seen in years.   And ringing in her ears are the life-giving words  “daughter of  Abraham.” .\r\n\r\nWe live in a world where people are beat up and put down.  We all  remember the saying, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words  will never hurt me.” Well, we know that’s not true. Do you remember Norm  from “Cheers”?  One day when he was asked how his day was, he  responded, “It’s a dog-eat-dog world and I’m wearing milk bone  underwear.”\r\n\r\nSome of you feel that way about this past week.  There are people all  around us who are stressed, anxious, fearful, angry, insecure or  discouraged.  They are everywhere.\r\n\r\nBut, here is the great news.  We have the unbelievable privilege of  looking people in the eye and saying to them, “You matter, your life  counts, God loves you, and God takes a personal interested in you.”\r\n\r\nHave you ever watched video footage from the Special Olympics.  I  love these clips.  As the kids compete, parents, friends and coaches  cheer wildly.   And as kids cross the finish line there is a mob of  hugging and cheering and celebrating.   It doesn’t matter how fast they  are or how gifted they are.  Every person is encouraged and cheered for  and celebrated.  If there is any group on earth that should demonstrate  this kind of encouragement, it is us – the body of Christ.\r\n\r\nWe should be excessive, obnoxious, and lavish with our encouragement.\r\n\r\nThere was a documentary about a woman who was facing significant  health issues.  When they asked her how she was managing to face the  challenges.  She led them upstairs to the master bathroom.\r\n\r\nShe simply pointed to the mirror. On the mirror were these words  written in lipstick by her young daughter.  “The best gift I could give  you is the gift to be able to see yourself as I see you.  You are my  hero.”\r\n\r\nProverbs 16:24 says, “Kind words are like honey – sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.”\r\n\r\nBefore we move on, I want to look at one more verse.\r\n\r\n“Encourage one another daily, as long as it’s called Today, so that  none of you may be hardened by sin''s deceitfulness.”  (Hebrews 3:13)\r\n\r\nThis is a great verse – it reminds us that all we really have is  today.  Our good intentions lead to many missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nI wonder how many people God put in my path this week.  But, missed  them, because I was so self-absorbed or moving to fast.  Jesus had this  wonderful capacity to “notice” people.  He never seemed to be rushed.   He never looked past them to someone more important.  He never seemed to  see people as an interruption or an annoyance.\r\n\r\nSo, how about it?  Who needs your encouragement?  Who could you bless this week with no strings attached?\r\nThere is one older gentleman I heard about that whenever he flies, he  picks up a few boxes of See’s candy.  And as he feels prompted and led,  he just gives them out to people as a way to encourage them.\r\n\r\nHowever, you choose to do it, let me challenge you to be a “blessing dispenser.”\r\n\r\nSo, we can appreciate people, encourage people and lastly, we can\r\n\r\nPray for people\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful privilege to be able to speak to people on behalf  of God.  But, it is an equal privilege to speak to God on behalf of  people.  In other words, we have the joy of carrying people and their  needs before the very presence of God.  We can prayer for our friends.\r\n\r\nThe Bible says that we can boldly go into his presence knowing that  he is a good Father who delights to meet the needs of his kids.  “So let  us boldly approach the throne of our gracious God with confidence – so  that we may receive  mercy and find grace to help us in our time of  need.” (Hebrews 4:16)\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful picture in the Old Testament that illustrates  this point.  It’s found in the book of Exodus.  It’s a picture of a  personal God who puts a premium on people.  In this passage, God builds  into the priestly duties the responsibility of carrying the people  before God.\r\n\r\n“Aaron will regularly carry the names of the sons of Israel, over his  heart, on the Breast-piece of Decision, as he enters the Sanctuary into  the presence of God. He will also put the Urim and the Thummim in the  breast-piece of decision.  So they may be over Aaron’s heart when he  enters the presence of the LORD God.  In this way Aaron will always  carry the Breast-piece of decision into the presence of God.” (Exodus  28:29-30)\r\n\r\nEvery time Aaron went to perform his priestly duties, he was reminded  of God’s heart for the people of Israel.  Each gem in the four rows of  stones represented a different tribe of Israel.  Every man, woman, boy  and girl was represented in those stones.  There wasn’t one person in  all of Israel that God didn’t love or care about.  It was Aaron’s job to  carry the people and their needs into the presence of the Lord.\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament, we learn that all of us who follow Jesus have  the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.  Like Aaron we carry our friends into  the presence of the Lord through prayer.\r\n\r\nAnd, here’s the good news.  You don’t have to go to the tabernacle  like Aaron.  You can go to the presence of God anytime, anywhere.  My  hope and prayer is that prayer becomes a lifestyle; an ongoing  conversation with God throughout the day.  While you are driving,  showering, taking a walk or sitting in front of your computer, you can  pray on behalf of the people that are in your heart.\r\n\r\nEphesians says, “Pray at all times.  Pray hard and long.  Pray for  your brothers and sisters.  Keep your eyes open.  Keep each other’s  spirits up so that no one falls behind.” (6:18)\r\n\r\nDid you hear that? Pray at all times (be persistent). Keep your eyes  open (Stay alert).  There is power in prayer.  Sometimes we minimize the  power of prayer and forget that prayer has the power to move heaven and  earth.\r\n\r\nJesus teaches in the Sermon on the Mount.\r\n\r\n“Keep on asking, and you will receive.  Keep on seeking, and you will  find.  Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.  For  everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone  who knocks, the door will be opened.  If your child ask for a loaf of  bread, do you give them a stone instead?  Or if they ask for a fish, do  you give them a snake?  Of course not!  So if you sinful people know how  to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in  heaven give good gifts to those who ask?” (Matthew 7:7-11)\r\n\r\nPrayer should be our first response not our last resort.  So, when  someone shares a need, a crisis, or praise, get in the habit of stopping  right then and there and praying.  People’s tears are often God’s  invitation to stop and pray.  Sometimes, the most important thing for  you to do is to pray on someone’s behalf.\r\n\r\nThe result is that people are encouraged, God’s power is unleashed,  and everyone’s faith is strengthened.  Can you imagine how it might  change our community and us if we just started praying for and with  people?  Can you imagine how it would impact people if we had no other  agenda than to bring their needs before God?  Let me challenge you give  it a try this coming week.  Make it your goal to pray with at least one  person that God brings your way. Take the risk. What do you have to  lose?  Go for it.\r\n\r\nI want to finish where we began. “Words kill, words give life.  They’re either poison or fruit – you chose.”(Proverbs 18:21)\r\n\r\nMay your words be life-giving this week.\r\n\r\n“May the Lord bless you and keep you; may the Lord make his face  shine upon you and be gracious to you, may the Lord turn his face toward  you and give you His peace.  May God’s gracious favor lead you to speak  sweeter this coming week.”', 'Live Like You''re Dying - 2.

(253, 1, '2008-02-24 21:47:16', '2008-02-24 21:47:16', 'Today we are talking about LOVE.  For those who may not have been  here the last 2 weeks, we are attempting to “Live Like You Were Dying.”   Here is the question we have been pondering. “If I only had 30 days  left on this earth, how would I live each day?  What would change?  In  the song “Live Like You Were Dying” there is a two word phrase with  enormous implications – “Love Deeper.”\r\n\r\nFor the record – this series is not about head knowledge, it’s about  action.  Our focus is on activating our hearts, our hands and our feet.   When your credit card is about to expire, they send you a new card with  a sticker that tells you that you must call the 1-800 number in order  to activate your card.  Until you activate the card – you can impress  your friends with your platinum card, but it’s good for nothing – until  you take action to put it into service.  The same is true for our Love.\r\n\r\nIf “Loving Deeper” were to become the passionate of your life what would that look like?\r\n\r\nPaul address this question in his 1st letter to the church in Corinth.\r\n\r\n“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I  am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. ... If I have all faith, so as to  remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I  have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I  gain nothing. 4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast;  it is not arrogant 5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is  not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but  rejoices with the truth.  Love bears all things, believes all things,  hopes all things, endures all things.  Love never ends. ... So faith,  hope, and love abide, but the greatest of these is love.” (1 Corinthians  13:1-13)\r\n\r\nWouldn’t it make sense that the longer we walk with the Jesus – the  more loving we would be?  Well, experience teaches that – that isn’t  always the case.  Over time, many Christians – become crusty, negative,  critical, and just plain grumpy.  What  I’ve discovered in my own life  is that you don’t just become more loving.  You need to pursue it.  You  need to be intentional. You need to take action.\r\n\r\nI know we hear the word “love” an awful lot in our culture.  In fact,  we use it so much, it has almost lost its meaning.”  For that reason,  you may find it easy to tune out today. But let me urge you to take a  hard look at yourself.  What is the condition of your heart?\r\n\r\nThis issue is so important that at the last supper Jesus takes time  to teach about love.  “A new commandment I give to you, that you love  one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.  By this all people will know that you are my disciples..." (John  13:34-35)\r\n\r\nSo, what’s the condition of your heart?  Are you becoming more  loving?  What would those closest to you say?  When we see darkness of  our own souls and when we realize how much God loves and forgives, it  changes everything.  When we really comprehend the totality of God’s  grace – love is the natural byproduct.  It shows up in our words.  It  shows up in our relationships.  It shows up in times of conflict.  It  shows up in how we interact with strangers.  When we feel loved, we are  more loving.\r\n\r\nSo, I challenge you to activate love in your life.  To understand this kind of love, let’s look at one day in Jesus’ life.\r\n\r\n“Six days before the Passover, Jesus entered Bethany where Lazarus,  so recently had been raised from the dead, was living.  Lazarus and his  sisters invited Jesus to dinner at their home.  Martha served.  Lazarus  was one of those sitting at table with him. Mary came in with a jar of  very expensive aromatic oils, and she anointed and massaged Jesus'' feet,  then she wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the  fragrance.\r\n\r\nJudas Iscariot, one of the disciple, even then getting ready to  betray him, said, “Why wasn’t that oil sold and the money given to the  poor?  It would have easily brought three hundred silver pieces.”  Not  that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief.  He was in charge  of their common funds, but he often stole some for himself.\r\n\r\nJesus said, “Let her alone.  She’s anticipating and honoring the day  of my burial.  You will always have the poor with you.  You will not  always have me.” (John 12:1-8)  Though this is a familiar story – it’s  interesting that Jesus is the one receiving an unrestrained gesture of  love.  I think this story, challenges our “play it safe,” “everything in  moderation,” “what will people think” approach to love.\r\n\r\nHere are 3 action steps I want all of us to work on next week.\r\n\r\nDo the unexpected (v.3)\r\n\r\nWhen we pick up the story, Jesus is in his final days.  His  crucifixion, the defining moment in human history, was looming on the  horizon.  He knows what is coming and he is aware of the suffering he  endure.\r\n\r\nHe knows his arrest is just around the corner.  Jesus wants to spend  these final days with people that he loves.  Passover is only a few days  away.  Passover was and is, a time for extended family to come to  gather, it was and still is a time for the Jews to remember how God  delivered Israel from the bondage of Egypt.\r\n\r\nOn this night Jesus is in Bethany which about 2 miles southeast of  Jerusalem.  A man named Simon is hosting a dinner party for Jesus and  some friends.  Once again Martha was there – Martha was the perfect  hostess and once again, we find Martha serving everyone.\r\n\r\nMary was also there that night.  We don’t know a lot about Mary, but  we do know that her love for Jesus ran deep.  And, on this night, she  does something spontaneous and unexpected.\r\n\r\nLet me set the scene.  Everyone is sitting around the table, laughing  and enjoying great conversation.  Martha is up serving coffee and  dessert.  Mary leaves the room and comes back with this alabaster  container.  She breaks the seal, and then does something that is “over  the top”.  She begins to pour out the whole bottle on Jesus.  She pours  out some on his feet, and Mark tells us that she also poured it on his  head.   Then, if that isn’t enough, Mary overcome with love in commits a  social taboo.  She lets down her hair.  This wasn’t acceptable in this  culture – woman would only let down her hair, in the presence of her  husband.  Then, Mary starts wiping Jesus’ feet with her hair.\r\n\r\nCan you sense the emotion of this scene?  Mary comes to Jesus with a  spontaneous, awkward, unrestrained, uninhibited, lavish, excessive  expression of love.  If had been there that night – I’m pretty sure I  would have been a little unnerved.  But, here’s the part that  overshadows the social awkwardness.  This was an act of joyous humility.   Mary didn’t care who was there or what they thought.\r\nI love the impulsiveness and spontaneity.  In a way, she gives what we  all want.  We all like being surprised by gestures of love.  We love a  surprise parties (we protest but ...)  And, all of us have all felt the  urge to do something lavish and “over the top” for someone we love.  But  most of the time – we stifle the urge – we choose to play it safe.   And, we miss the chance to watch people light up because we took the  risk to love.\r\n\r\nI just wonder how many times this past week we missed an opportunity  to surprise someone with love.  We live in a world that is driven to  achieve.  We are obsessed with efficiency and productivity.  Our hard  driving, bottom line lifestyle fights against spontaneous acts of love.\r\n\r\nIf I am honest, too often I pass by the person who needs to be  surprised by love.  I have too many “important” things on my schedule to  be spontaneous with my love.  We rationalize because there is no margin  in our lives for something so impulsive.  And with each time we push  the urge back down our hearts shrink and shrivel just a little more.\r\n\r\nThere was a church that decided to reach out to the college that was  right across the street from the church.  They printed up brochures  inviting the students to worship with this congregation and they placed  in the student mailboxes.  Most of the folks were skeptical, but went  along with the idea.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning the people in the church looked around and just as  they suspected, there were no college students.  Just when the pastor  started to preach and a young man, obviously a college student, walked  through the door.  He was wearing tattered jeans and a t-shirt.   He was  looking for a place to sit, trying not to disturb the service.  No one  moved or offer him a seat.  Finally, he simply plopped down on the floor  in the middle of the aisle.\r\n\r\nThe pastor wasn’t quite sure what to do, so he just kept preaching.   Finally, after a couple of minutes one of the old elders got up.  He was  a long time member of the church and started down the aisle in his coat  and tie.  People in the congregation thought, “Finally, it is about  time someone in leadership went and told the young man that this was  inappropriate for a worship service.”  The elder reached the front of  the church where the college student was sitting.  And, without saying a  word, he sat on the floor with the young man and stayed there through  the rest of the sermon.\r\n\r\nI love stories like that because they are about unexpected love.    So, how about it?  Who could you surprise with your love this week?  Who  could you ambush with grace and kindness?  Go for it this week.  When  you feel the prompting, say “yes.”  You are never off track when you are  expressing love to people.\r\n\r\nSo, the first action step is to do the unexpected…the second action step is…\r\n\r\nDo the unaffordable\r\n\r\nLet’s go back to the scene that night at the dinner party.\r\n\r\nIn the room that night there were other invited guests.  John tells  us how Judas reacted – he said: “Why wasn’t that oil sold and the money  given to the poor?  It would have easily brought three hundred silver  pieces.”   Judas did not applaud her spontaneous gesture of love.   He  saw it as wasteful, inappropriate, and careless.\r\nThere is something about the price tag of a gift that says something  about our love.  I know we say that you can’t put a price on love.  But  guys, next anniversary, try giving your wife a $29 blender.  And, then  write on the gift tag “remember, it’s the thought that counts”.\r\nThere’s a show on television that has been a phenomenon.  It has no sex,  no violence, and no political corruption and yet it has been wildly  popular.  It’s called “Extreme Makeover.”  This is a show where they  identify an extremely needy family whose home is usually in very bad  disrepair.  Then, Ty Pennington and his design team, along with hundreds  of workers converge on the house and in one week’s time do an extreme  make-over.  Part of the success of the show is not what they do, but how  they do it.  They don’t just come in and make a few repairs, slap on a  new coat of paint and call it day.   Sometimes they tear down the whole  house and put in its place a brand new, spacious, beautifully designed  and decorated home.  Part of what makes this show fun to watch is that  what they do is “over the top.”  It is lavish. They spare no expense.   They do things for these families that they could never even dream of  doing for themselves.  It’s the “extreme” part of the show that makes it  so popular.\r\n\r\nThe New Testament, is full of the same kind of “over the top” love.   You find Christians doing the unaffordable.  Just days or weeks after  the first church was launched in Jerusalem, you read these remarkable  words.\r\n\r\n“All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that  any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they  had.” (Acts 4:32)  They loved Jesus and their fellow believers so much  that they did the unexpected and unaffordable.  Their love was “over the  top.”\r\n\r\nThen, later Paul writes to the church at Corinth about the believers  in Macedonia.   These were very poor Christians going through many  difficult problems.  Paul was collecting an offering to take to the  saints down in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nListen to Paul’s description of their love.\r\n\r\n“I was there and saw it for myself.  They gave offerings of whatever  they could – far more than they could afford!  Pleading for the  privilege of helping out in the relief of poor Christians.”(2  Corinthians 8:3-4)\r\n\r\nTalk about “extreme” Christianity.  They begged Paul to take up an  offering from them.  When is the last time you saw that in a church?\r\n\r\nHowever, without question, the most extreme example of love was  demonstrated on the cross.  It was the most costly gesture of love in  the history of man.\r\n\r\n“For Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.   Now, most people wouldn’t be willing to die for an upright person,  though someone might be willing to die for a person who is especially  good.  But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for  us while we were still sinners.” (Romans 5:6-8)\r\n\r\nGiving is always attached to loving.  Being generous demonstrates  love.  So, who can you bless this week with an “over the top” expression  of love.  I want to challenge you this next week to do something  unaffordable, something sacrificial, and something extravagant.  Let me  ask you, what is the 21st century equivalent for this woman’s jar of  perfume?  What precious, valuable thing do you have that you could  lavish on someone else as an expression of your love?\r\n\r\nNot everyone will applaud.  Some won’t understand.  Some will accuse  you of being wasteful. So what?  Go for it.   In the name of Jesus,  let’s break open the perfume bottles this week.\r\n\r\nSo, from this wonderful story, we learn that when we ambush someone  with love, we do the unexpected.  Then we do the unaffordable.\r\n\r\nThere is one final thing I want to ask you to do.\r\n\r\nDo it now\r\n\r\nI’m sure you could have heard a pin drop.  Can you imagine how Mary  must have been feeling at this point?   She was motivated by love.  She  thought she was doing a good thing.  Now she is being blasted.\r\n\r\nBut before the detractors can say anything else,\r\n\r\nJesus rushes to defend this woman.\r\n\r\nListen to what Mark reports:\r\n\r\nBut Jesus said, “Let her alone. Why are you giving her a hard time?   She has done something wonderfully significant for me.  You will always  have the poor with you every day for the rest of your lives.  Whenever  you feel like it, you can do something for them.  Not so with me.  She  did what she could – she pre-anointed my body for burial. (Mark 14:6-8)\r\n\r\nMary did a good thing.  Jesus isn’t minimizing the need to care for  the poor.  He is simply saying that this woman has done a good thing in  seizing the moment to show love.  She would not have this opportunity  again.\r\n\r\nYou can’t ask for any more. She did what she could with what she had.   She didn’t know that Jesus was about to be crucified.  But she saw an  opportunity to express her love and she grabbed it.  And, now her story  lives on thousands of years later.\r\n\r\nWe really don’t know if we will be here a week from now.  We only  have today. We may only have right now.  We have this moment.  We can’t  do everything.  We can’t meet every need.  We can’t bless every person.   We can only do what we can.\r\n\r\nFor some of us, the most radical expression of our love might be to  speak it.  Some folks are not very good at saying those life-giving  words – I love you.  There are people all around you that are affection  starved.  Some of those people may be sitting with you and around you  today.  They have learned to hide the pain and they would never ask for  it, but they long to hear you say, “I love you”.   I hope before you  even get out of the parking lot today, that you will grab a spouse, a  child, a good friend and look them in the eye and say “I just want you  to know that I love you. I am glad you are in my life.  My life is  better and richer because of you.”   Words of love and affirmation and  blessing ought to flow more freely in this group here today than any  other group of people in this town.   Don’t wait.  Do it now.\r\n\r\nA few years back there was an article in the Chicago Tribune that is  sobering reminder that we don’t always have much time.  Bob Greene  writes about a dad who is saying good-bye to a three-and-a-half-year-old  son.  Like all of us he thought he would have his son for a life time.   But a diagnosis of a brain tumor shattered their world.  Listen to an  excerpt from this father to his son.\r\n\r\n“Dear Casey, As I lie in bed holding you, I am so painfully aware  that you will only be with us for only a few more minutes or hours, and  my heart breaks when I think of the struggles you have endured in the  last eight months.  I would give anything to switch places with you.   Nothing would make me happier.\r\n\r\nAs you close your eyes and decide when you want to go to heaven,  remember how proud I am of you.  From the day you were born until today,  you have brought me only joy.  You have exceeded my highest  expectations of what fatherhood would be like.  You have not only been  my son, but you have been my dearest friend.  Whenever I was at work or  out of town, I would ache to be with you.  I will miss you terribly.\r\n\r\nAll I have learned from you validates that my life is on the right  course and that my values are in the right place.  How else could I have  such a wonderful boy?  For this I thank you.  We will never forget the  happiness you brought us.  I am the luckiest man in the world to have  been your father and friend.  I love you madly.  So Casey, it''s OK to  close your eyes now.  You don''t have to fight anymore.  Thanks for being  my son. Love Dad.”\r\n\r\nYou just never know how many more opportunities you will have.  So, do it now.\r\n\r\nFor some of you this week, God will call you to a radical expression  of generosity.  Maybe it is doing something for a widow in our church or  a friend who has lost a job or a single mom who needs a car or a  student in your school who is outcast.  Maybe it is blessing someone on  the mission field or an unexpected opportunity that God will bring  across your path this week.  Look for opportunities this week.\r\n\r\nWho knows the impact your love could have?  Can you imagine what  could happen if just the people gathered in this room today took this  seriously.  What if our primary objective this week wasn’t a paycheck,  or our to-do list, or getting a new gadget but this week we lived to  love.\r\n\r\nWhat if this week we broke open the perfume?\r\n\r\nThe final part of this story comes from the lips of Jesus.\r\n\r\n“I tell you the truth, wherever the Good News – the gospel – is  preached throughout the world, this woman''s deed will be remembered and  discussed.” ( Mark 14:9)\r\n\r\nMy greatest dream for our church is that – When it is all said and  done and when history is written our legacy be a legacy of extravagant  love for Jesus.', 'Live Like You Were Dying - 3.

(255, 1, '2010-09-27 21:48:04', '2010-09-27 21:48:04', 'Today we are talking about LOVE.  For those who may not have been  here the last 2 weeks, we are attempting to “Live Like You Were Dying.”   Here is the question we have been pondering. “If I only had 30 days  left on this earth, how would I live each day?  What would change?  In  the song “Live Like You Were Dying” there is a two word phrase with  enormous implications – “Love Deeper.”\r\n\r\nFor the record – this series is not about head knowledge, it’s about  action.  Our focus is on activating our hearts, our hands and our feet.   When your credit card is about to expire, they send you a new card with  a sticker that tells you that you must call the 1-800 number in order  to activate your card.  Until you activate the card – you can impress  your friends with your platinum card, but it’s good for nothing – until  you take action to put it into service.  The same is true for our Love.\r\n\r\nIf “Loving Deeper” were to become the passionate of your life what would that look like?\r\n\r\nPaul address this question in his 1st letter to the church in Corinth.\r\n\r\n“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I  am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. ... If I have all faith, so as to  remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I  have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I  gain nothing. 4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast;  it is not arrogant 5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is  not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but  rejoices with the truth.  Love bears all things, believes all things,  hopes all things, endures all things.  Love never ends. ... So faith,  hope, and love abide, but the greatest of these is love.” (1 Corinthians  13:1-13)\r\n\r\nWouldn’t it make sense that the longer we walk with the Jesus – the  more loving we would be?  Well, experience teaches that – that isn’t  always the case.  Over time, many Christians – become crusty, negative,  critical, and just plain grumpy.  What  I’ve discovered in my own life  is that you don’t just become more loving.  You need to pursue it.  You  need to be intentional. You need to take action.\r\n\r\nI know we hear the word “love” an awful lot in our culture.  In fact,  we use it so much, it has almost lost its meaning.”  For that reason,  you may find it easy to tune out today. But let me urge you to take a  hard look at yourself.  What is the condition of your heart?\r\n\r\nThis issue is so important that at the last supper Jesus takes time  to teach about love.  “A new commandment I give to you, that you love  one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.  By this all people will know that you are my disciples..." (John  13:34-35)\r\n\r\nSo, what’s the condition of your heart?  Are you becoming more  loving?  What would those closest to you say?  When we see darkness of  our own souls and when we realize how much God loves and forgives, it  changes everything.  When we really comprehend the totality of God’s  grace – love is the natural byproduct.  It shows up in our words.  It  shows up in our relationships.  It shows up in times of conflict.  It  shows up in how we interact with strangers.  When we feel loved, we are  more loving.\r\n\r\nSo, I challenge you to activate love in your life.  To understand this kind of love, let’s look at one day in Jesus’ life.\r\n\r\n“Six days before the Passover, Jesus entered Bethany where Lazarus,  so recently had been raised from the dead, was living.  Lazarus and his  sisters invited Jesus to dinner at their home.  Martha served.  Lazarus  was one of those sitting at table with him. Mary came in with a jar of  very expensive aromatic oils, and she anointed and massaged Jesus'' feet,  then she wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the  fragrance.\r\n\r\nJudas Iscariot, one of the disciple, even then getting ready to  betray him, said, “Why wasn’t that oil sold and the money given to the  poor?  It would have easily brought three hundred silver pieces.”  Not  that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief.  He was in charge  of their common funds, but he often stole some for himself.\r\n\r\nJesus said, “Let her alone.  She’s anticipating and honoring the day  of my burial.  You will always have the poor with you.  You will not  always have me.” (John 12:1-8)  Though this is a familiar story – it’s  interesting that Jesus is the one receiving an unrestrained gesture of  love.  I think this story, challenges our “play it safe,” “everything in  moderation,” “what will people think” approach to love.\r\n\r\nHere are 3 action steps I want all of us to work on next week.\r\n\r\nDo the unexpected (v.3)\r\n\r\nWhen we pick up the story, Jesus is in his final days.  His  crucifixion, the defining moment in human history, was looming on the  horizon.  He knows what is coming and he is aware of the suffering he  endure.\r\n\r\nHe knows his arrest is just around the corner.  Jesus wants to spend  these final days with people that he loves.  Passover is only a few days  away.  Passover was and is, a time for extended family to come to  gather, it was and still is a time for the Jews to remember how God  delivered Israel from the bondage of Egypt.\r\n\r\nOn this night Jesus is in Bethany which about 2 miles southeast of  Jerusalem.  A man named Simon is hosting a dinner party for Jesus and  some friends.  Once again Martha was there – Martha was the perfect  hostess and once again, we find Martha serving everyone.\r\n\r\nMary was also there that night.  We don’t know a lot about Mary, but  we do know that her love for Jesus ran deep.  And, on this night, she  does something spontaneous and unexpected.\r\n\r\nLet me set the scene.  Everyone is sitting around the table, laughing  and enjoying great conversation.  Martha is up serving coffee and  dessert.  Mary leaves the room and comes back with this alabaster  container.  She breaks the seal, and then does something that is “over  the top”.  She begins to pour out the whole bottle on Jesus.  She pours  out some on his feet, and Mark tells us that she also poured it on his  head.   Then, if that isn’t enough, Mary overcome with love in commits a  social taboo.  She lets down her hair.  This wasn’t acceptable in this  culture – woman would only let down her hair, in the presence of her  husband.  Then, Mary starts wiping Jesus’ feet with her hair.\r\n\r\nCan you sense the emotion of this scene?  Mary comes to Jesus with a  spontaneous, awkward, unrestrained, uninhibited, lavish, excessive  expression of love.  If had been there that night – I’m pretty sure I  would have been a little unnerved.  But, here’s the part that  overshadows the social awkwardness.  This was an act of joyous humility.   Mary didn’t care who was there or what they thought.\r\nI love the impulsiveness and spontaneity.  In a way, she gives what we  all want.  We all like being surprised by gestures of love.  We love a  surprise parties (we protest but ...)  And, all of us have all felt the  urge to do something lavish and “over the top” for someone we love.  But  most of the time – we stifle the urge – we choose to play it safe.   And, we miss the chance to watch people light up because we took the  risk to love.\r\n\r\nI just wonder how many times this past week we missed an opportunity  to surprise someone with love.  We live in a world that is driven to  achieve.  We are obsessed with efficiency and productivity.  Our hard  driving, bottom line lifestyle fights against spontaneous acts of love.\r\n\r\nIf I am honest, too often I pass by the person who needs to be  surprised by love.  I have too many “important” things on my schedule to  be spontaneous with my love.  We rationalize because there is no margin  in our lives for something so impulsive.  And with each time we push  the urge back down our hearts shrink and shrivel just a little more.\r\n\r\nThere was a church that decided to reach out to the college that was  right across the street from the church.  They printed up brochures  inviting the students to worship with this congregation and they placed  in the student mailboxes.  Most of the folks were skeptical, but went  along with the idea.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning the people in the church looked around and just as  they suspected, there were no college students.  Just when the pastor  started to preach and a young man, obviously a college student, walked  through the door.  He was wearing tattered jeans and a t-shirt.   He was  looking for a place to sit, trying not to disturb the service.  No one  moved or offer him a seat.  Finally, he simply plopped down on the floor  in the middle of the aisle.\r\n\r\nThe pastor wasn’t quite sure what to do, so he just kept preaching.   Finally, after a couple of minutes one of the old elders got up.  He was  a long time member of the church and started down the aisle in his coat  and tie.  People in the congregation thought, “Finally, it is about  time someone in leadership went and told the young man that this was  inappropriate for a worship service.”  The elder reached the front of  the church where the college student was sitting.  And, without saying a  word, he sat on the floor with the young man and stayed there through  the rest of the sermon.\r\n\r\nI love stories like that because they are about unexpected love.    So, how about it?  Who could you surprise with your love this week?  Who  could you ambush with grace and kindness?  Go for it this week.  When  you feel the prompting, say “yes.”  You are never off track when you are  expressing love to people.\r\n\r\nSo, the first action step is to do the unexpected…the second action step is…\r\n\r\nDo the unaffordable\r\n\r\nLet’s go back to the scene that night at the dinner party.\r\n\r\nIn the room that night there were other invited guests.  John tells  us how Judas reacted – he said: “Why wasn’t that oil sold and the money  given to the poor?  It would have easily brought three hundred silver  pieces.”   Judas did not applaud her spontaneous gesture of love.   He  saw it as wasteful, inappropriate, and careless.\r\nThere is something about the price tag of a gift that says something  about our love.  I know we say that you can’t put a price on love.  But  guys, next anniversary, try giving your wife a $29 blender.  And, then  write on the gift tag “remember, it’s the thought that counts”.\r\nThere’s a show on television that has been a phenomenon.  It has no sex,  no violence, and no political corruption and yet it has been wildly  popular.  It’s called “Extreme Makeover.”  This is a show where they  identify an extremely needy family whose home is usually in very bad  disrepair.  Then, Ty Pennington and his design team, along with hundreds  of workers converge on the house and in one week’s time do an extreme  make-over.  Part of the success of the show is not what they do, but how  they do it.  They don’t just come in and make a few repairs, slap on a  new coat of paint and call it day.   Sometimes they tear down the whole  house and put in its place a brand new, spacious, beautifully designed  and decorated home.  Part of what makes this show fun to watch is that  what they do is “over the top.”  It is lavish. They spare no expense.   They do things for these families that they could never even dream of  doing for themselves.  It’s the “extreme” part of the show that makes it  so popular.\r\n\r\nThe New Testament, is full of the same kind of “over the top” love.   You find Christians doing the unaffordable.  Just days or weeks after  the first church was launched in Jerusalem, you read these remarkable  words.\r\n\r\n“All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that  any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they  had.” (Acts 4:32)  They loved Jesus and their fellow believers so much  that they did the unexpected and unaffordable.  Their love was “over the  top.”\r\n\r\nThen, later Paul writes to the church at Corinth about the believers  in Macedonia.   These were very poor Christians going through many  difficult problems.  Paul was collecting an offering to take to the  saints down in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nListen to Paul’s description of their love.\r\n\r\n“I was there and saw it for myself.  They gave offerings of whatever  they could – far more than they could afford!  Pleading for the  privilege of helping out in the relief of poor Christians.”(2  Corinthians 8:3-4)\r\n\r\nTalk about “extreme” Christianity.  They begged Paul to take up an  offering from them.  When is the last time you saw that in a church?\r\n\r\nHowever, without question, the most extreme example of love was  demonstrated on the cross.  It was the most costly gesture of love in  the history of man.\r\n\r\n“For Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.   Now, most people wouldn’t be willing to die for an upright person,  though someone might be willing to die for a person who is especially  good.  But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for  us while we were still sinners.” (Romans 5:6-8)\r\n\r\nGiving is always attached to loving.  Being generous demonstrates  love.  So, who can you bless this week with an “over the top” expression  of love.  I want to challenge you this next week to do something  unaffordable, something sacrificial, and something extravagant.  Let me  ask you, what is the 21st century equivalent for this woman’s jar of  perfume?  What precious, valuable thing do you have that you could  lavish on someone else as an expression of your love?\r\n\r\nNot everyone will applaud.  Some won’t understand.  Some will accuse  you of being wasteful. So what?  Go for it.   In the name of Jesus,  let’s break open the perfume bottles this week.\r\n\r\nSo, from this wonderful story, we learn that when we ambush someone  with love, we do the unexpected.  Then we do the unaffordable.\r\n\r\nThere is one final thing I want to ask you to do.\r\n\r\nDo it now\r\n\r\nI’m sure you could have heard a pin drop.  Can you imagine how Mary  must have been feeling at this point?   She was motivated by love.  She  thought she was doing a good thing.  Now she is being blasted.\r\n\r\nBut before the detractors can say anything else,\r\n\r\nJesus rushes to defend this woman.\r\n\r\nListen to what Mark reports:\r\n\r\nBut Jesus said, “Let her alone. Why are you giving her a hard time?   She has done something wonderfully significant for me.  You will always  have the poor with you every day for the rest of your lives.  Whenever  you feel like it, you can do something for them.  Not so with me.  She  did what she could – she pre-anointed my body for burial. (Mark 14:6-8)\r\n\r\nMary did a good thing.  Jesus isn’t minimizing the need to care for  the poor.  He is simply saying that this woman has done a good thing in  seizing the moment to show love.  She would not have this opportunity  again.\r\n\r\nYou can’t ask for any more. She did what she could with what she had.   She didn’t know that Jesus was about to be crucified.  But she saw an  opportunity to express her love and she grabbed it.  And, now her story  lives on thousands of years later.\r\n\r\nWe really don’t know if we will be here a week from now.  We only  have today. We may only have right now.  We have this moment.  We can’t  do everything.  We can’t meet every need.  We can’t bless every person.   We can only do what we can.\r\n\r\nFor some of us, the most radical expression of our love might be to  speak it.  Some folks are not very good at saying those life-giving  words – I love you.  There are people all around you that are affection  starved.  Some of those people may be sitting with you and around you  today.  They have learned to hide the pain and they would never ask for  it, but they long to hear you say, “I love you”.   I hope before you  even get out of the parking lot today, that you will grab a spouse, a  child, a good friend and look them in the eye and say “I just want you  to know that I love you. I am glad you are in my life.  My life is  better and richer because of you.”   Words of love and affirmation and  blessing ought to flow more freely in this group here today than any  other group of people in this town.   Don’t wait.  Do it now.\r\n\r\nA few years back there was an article in the Chicago Tribune that is  sobering reminder that we don’t always have much time.  Bob Greene  writes about a dad who is saying good-bye to a three-and-a-half-year-old  son.  Like all of us he thought he would have his son for a life time.   But a diagnosis of a brain tumor shattered their world.  Listen to an  excerpt from this father to his son.\r\n\r\n“Dear Casey, As I lie in bed holding you, I am so painfully aware  that you will only be with us for only a few more minutes or hours, and  my heart breaks when I think of the struggles you have endured in the  last eight months.  I would give anything to switch places with you.   Nothing would make me happier.\r\n\r\nAs you close your eyes and decide when you want to go to heaven,  remember how proud I am of you.  From the day you were born until today,  you have brought me only joy.  You have exceeded my highest  expectations of what fatherhood would be like.  You have not only been  my son, but you have been my dearest friend.  Whenever I was at work or  out of town, I would ache to be with you.  I will miss you terribly.\r\n\r\nAll I have learned from you validates that my life is on the right  course and that my values are in the right place.  How else could I have  such a wonderful boy?  For this I thank you.  We will never forget the  happiness you brought us.  I am the luckiest man in the world to have  been your father and friend.  I love you madly.  So Casey, it''s OK to  close your eyes now.  You don''t have to fight anymore.  Thanks for being  my son. Love Dad.”\r\n\r\nYou just never know how many more opportunities you will have.  So, do it now.\r\n\r\nFor some of you this week, God will call you to a radical expression  of generosity.  Maybe it is doing something for a widow in our church or  a friend who has lost a job or a single mom who needs a car or a  student in your school who is outcast.  Maybe it is blessing someone on  the mission field or an unexpected opportunity that God will bring  across your path this week.  Look for opportunities this week.\r\n\r\nWho knows the impact your love could have?  Can you imagine what  could happen if just the people gathered in this room today took this  seriously.  What if our primary objective this week wasn’t a paycheck,  or our to-do list, or getting a new gadget but this week we lived to  love.\r\n\r\nWhat if this week we broke open the perfume?\r\n\r\nThe final part of this story comes from the lips of Jesus.\r\n\r\n“I tell you the truth, wherever the Good News – the gospel – is  preached throughout the world, this woman''s deed will be remembered and  discussed.” ( Mark 14:9)\r\n\r\nMy greatest dream for our church is that – When it is all said and  done and when history is written our legacy be a legacy of extravagant  love for Jesus.', 'Live Like You Were Dying - 3.

(256, 1, '2008-03-02 21:48:59', '2008-03-02 21:48:59', 'When you came in today, you were given a small rock.  We are going to  let those rocks symbolize our own struggle with forgiveness.\r\n\r\nThis is the 4th in our sermon series called “Live Like You Were  Dying.”  We have been staring in the face the reality that we will not  be here forever.  Our days are numbered. Here is the question we have  been wrestling with during this series,  “If I only had 30 days to live,  how would I spend my time?”  How would I change? What would I start  doing that I haven’t been doing?  This challenging adventure is changing  our perspective.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have looked at what it means to live for that which  matters most.  We have looked at Embracing each Day, Loving more deeply  and Speaking more sweetly.\r\n\r\nToday’s sermon deals with what may be the most difficult subject we’ve looked at.\r\n\r\nFor some, this will be a defining moment in your spiritual journey.    Others will walk out of here today freer than they have been in years.   Some are going to leave a burden here that you have been carrying for a  long, long time.  Today we are going to talk about forgiveness.\r\n\r\nYou’ve heard that “time heals all wounds.”  But, it just isn’t true.   For some, even though it has been years, the wounds are still raw,  fresh, and real.  Isn’t it amazing how God has wired us?  Life’s  greatest joys and life’s most agonizing wounds both come from the same  place.  They come from relationships.  God has made us with the capacity  to love deeply, but he has also made us with the capacity to hurt  deeply.\r\n\r\nSo, if you only had 30 days to live, are there relationships that  need to be repaired and restored?  Is there some bitterness that needs  to be resolved?  Do you have some unfinished business you need to take  care of before you check out of this life?\r\n\r\nEach of you was given a rock today because this struggle with  forgiveness is a challenge for all of us.  Somewhere along the way, we  all have been hurt, wounded, betrayed, or abandoned.  The truth is, we  all know what it is to carry around a rock of un-forgiveness.  I’m sure  you will be surprised, but, none of us are perfect.  And, that’s OK.  We  are a collection of broken people who have been redeemed and restored  by God’s grace.\r\n\r\nGod is not surprised or shocked by the fact that you are carrying a  rock today.  In fact, he wants to help lighten your load.  But, you  can’t pretend the rock isn’t there or try to hide it any longer.\r\n\r\nThink about going to the airport.  You check in at the counter, get  your boarding pass and then you head off to the security line.  You know  the drill.  Show your boarding pass, show your ID, pull out your  laptop, take the change out of your pocket, take off your shoes, your  belt, take off your watch – put your carry-on bag the belt.  As your bag  passes through the X-ray, there is a TSA agent watching.  It’s their  job to discover it, identify it, and then remove it.  They do this to  protect you and the rest of us.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the Lord X-rays our stuff to protect us from  ourselves.   Sometimes, he looks inside and he says “That rock of  unforgiveness, is dangerous.  It will hurt you.”\r\n\r\nLike the TSA agent, the Lord is on your side.  Unlike the TSA agent –  the Lord knows you, He loves you, and he only wants the best for you.\r\n\r\nSo, here is what I’m asking today.  I want us to really be honest  with ourselves and with God.  I want you to open up and I want you to  let the Lord, show you anything that might be hurtful or dangerous.\r\n\r\nAs we look at forgiveness, I want to establish the baseline of God’s  expectation.  As followers of Jesus, we are given a high standard when  it comes to relationships. Paul writes to the Church on Rome: “Do all  that you can to live in peace with everyone.”  (Romans 12:18)\r\n\r\nLive in peace with everyone. There isn’t much wiggle room.  There is  no disclaimer, no exception, no loophole, and no escape hatch.  I am to  do everything possible to live in peace with everyone.\r\n\r\nOne day Peter, asked Jesus about forgiveness. He wanted to know where  the boundary was.  So, he point blank asks Jesus, “How many times shall  I forgive my brother?  Up to seven times?”  Peter thinks he is being  super-spiritual and going way beyond the call of duty by suggesting  seven times.\r\n\r\nJesus’ response is shocking.  He says, “Not seven times, but seventy  times seven.”  Then Jesus tell a about forgiveness.  Let me try to bring  the story into the 21st century.\r\n\r\nIt is the story of a multi-billion dollar corporation.  One day the  CEO, gets a memo from the accounting department. One of their vendors  has run up an enormous debt.  The CEO wants to know why this wasn’t  discovered earlier.  Being the no nonsense businessman, he wants a  meeting with this vendor immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen this vendor gets word that, about the meeting, his heart sinks.   He panics.  What is he going to do?  He knows that he can’t pay the  bill.  He owes more than 10 million dollars.  The only thing he can do  is plead for mercy.  But CEO’s don’t get where they are by showing  mercy.\r\n\r\nWhen he gets to the corporate headquarters, he is taken to the CEO’s  office – where he is presented with a detailed accounting of his debt.   The CEO lets him know that this obligation is due in full.  It’s due  Today.\r\n\r\nThe CEO tells him, that they plan exercise the full force of the law.   They will seize all of his assets, liquidate his property and  possessions.  They will do whatever is necessary to recover this debt.   And, after that they do all they can to see him in prison.\r\n\r\nIn desperation, this man falls on his knees – begging for mercy,  begging for more time.  He promises to pay back every dime.  And, then,  the unthinkable, the unimaginable, the unbelievable happens.  The CEO is  moved with compassion.  And in a moment of unbelievable compassion, he  shreds the file canceling the debt.  He doesn’t give him more time, he  pardons him.\r\n\r\nBut the story isn’t over.  On his way home he stops for gas where he  bumps into a client who has been avoiding him because he owes a few  hundred dollars that he hasn’t paid.  His sense of relief and freedom  vanishes and is immediately replaced by resentment and anger. He demands  payment immediately.  The client, begs for more time and promises that  he will pay back every dime.  Sound familiar?  But, this guy will hear  none of it.  He presses charges and has the client thrown in jail.\r\n\r\nHow ungrateful can you be?  How could a man who had been forgiven so much – not forgive someone so little?   That’s the point.\r\n\r\nFrom this powerful story, I want to challenge you with two choices and a word of caution.\r\n\r\nYou’ve been released from God’s judgment – celebrate.\r\n\r\nOne of my fears is that we have lost the sense of this forgiveness.\r\n\r\nWe tend to subscribe to the philosophy out lined in the book – “I’m  OK, You’re OK.”  We’re not!  I’m thinking about writing a book – “I’m  not ok, and you’re really messed up.”\r\n\r\nThe Bible doesn’t pull any punches as it discusses the nature of man.   In the Old Testament, we read that the heart is desperately wicked.   Paul write in Romans: "No one is good – not even one. (Romans 3:10)\r\n\r\nIn Ephesians  we read, “we were by nature objects of wrath” – we  didn’t come into the world innocent – we arrived with a hearts tainted  and poisoned by sin. (Ephesians 2:4)\r\n\r\nA group of five, Buddhist monks from Japan visited one of the larger  evangelical churches in USA.  One of them said, “The most difficult  thing for me to accept about Christian belief is the belief in a sin  nature.  I just don’t get it.”\r\n\r\nFor me this is easy to believe – because the evidence is all around  us.  Just look at every two year-old you know.  You don’t have to teach  them to be selfish, to lie, to fight, or to throw a fit when they don’t  get their way.  No, they come into the world with a sin nature.\r\n\r\nPaul describes our condition in his letter to the Colossians:  “At  one time you were far away from God and were his enemies because of the  evil things you did and thought.” (Colossians 1:21)\r\n\r\nDid you hear that?  We were the enemies of God.  Like the man in the  story, we have an enormous debt that we can never pay.  We are hopeless  and helpless.  Our debt was so large – that the only solution was for  God to send His only son – Jesus Christ – to come and die on the cross –  to pay our debt.\r\n\r\nThe Lord our God showed mercy and compassion – when we had no hope of  every paying off our debt – He shredded our file.  Changing metaphors –  Jesus death was God stamping our note “paid in full.”   I deserved  punishment.  I got pardoned.  I deserved judgment.  I got Jesus.  I  deserved eternal condemnation.  I got eternal salvation.  I deserved  hell.  I got heaven.\r\n\r\nBefore we go any further, I want to make sure that you have received  the gift of God’s forgiveness and know what it is to be pardoned of the  enormous debt of your sin.\r\n\r\nIf you only had thirty days to live, nothing would be more important  than getting this settled. Where you spend eternity is at stake.  Jesus  has already paid the price and God offers salvation to you as a gift.   It is yours to simply receive.  Right now, by faith, you can receive the  gift of eternal life.  Once and for all, you can have your debt  forgiven.  So, don’t wait.\r\n\r\nThere is a direct connection between our sense of being forgiven and  our ability to forgive.  In other words, when we feel forgiven, we are  am more forgiving.  God’s forgiveness of our enormous debt is the  starting place in our discussion about forgiving others.\r\n\r\nPaul writes these words to the Ephesians: “Don’t grieve the Holy  Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.   Let  all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away  from you, along with all malice.  Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,  forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.” (Ephesians  4:30-32)\r\n\r\nSo, the starting place is to choose to celebrate how much we have been forgiven.\r\n\r\nThen, we are to:\r\n\r\nRelease others from our judgment – liberate\r\n\r\nThat statement is not meant to minimize anything that you might have  been through or how much someone might have hurt you.   Rather, compared  to what we have been forgiven by God, every other debt is small.  This I  know.  We can never forgive someone more than what God has forgiven us.\r\n\r\nProverbs 19:11 says, “A man''s wisdom gives him patience; it is to his  glory to overlook an offense.”  We are never more like God and we are  never more glorious than when we forgive.\r\nBut, forgiving is not easy – it doesn’t come natural.  We want justice.   We want people to get what they deserve.  Sir Walter Scott said that  revenge “is the sweetest morsel to the mouth that was ever cooked in  hell.”\r\n\r\nLetting people off the hook isn’t easy.  But, God calls us to  forgive. I want to make this perfectly clear.  Forgiveness is a choice.   Every time you are offended or hurt, you have a choice to make. Will  you choose resentment and bitterness or will you choose forgiveness?\r\n\r\nWe even use the phrase “nurse a grudge”.  When you nurse something,  you do all you can to keep it alive.  So we feed our grudges with angry  thoughts and hostile feelings.  Then we justify our right to hold the  grudge.  After all, look what they did to us.\r\n\r\nHow many of you know what TIVO is?  It is a device that allows you to  record your favorite programs – then you can watch them whenever you  want.  There are folks who’ve TIVO’d their hurts.  So, they can play  them back time after time.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of the guy who told his friend that his “wife was so  upset she went historical.”  His friend said “Don’t you mean  hysterical?”  “No, I mean historical – she brought up everything I had  ever done wrong.” We have an amazing ability to hang on to our hurts.\r\n\r\nSome of us have grudges that we’ve been nursing for a long time.   But, we do have a choice – we can let go or we hang on to them.\r\n\r\nWhat are some clues that you may need to choose to forgive?\r\n\r\nYou feel resentment toward somebody.  In fact, their name may have just come to mind.\r\nWhen their name comes up, you are instantly critical.  You can’t stop  thinking about the hurt.  You keep pushing replay and rehearsing a  hurtful incident.\r\n\r\nYour homework assignment – if you choose to accept it.  Go to your  spouse or a good friend and ask them, "Who do I need to forgive?"\r\n\r\nSo, what does it mean to forgive?  Does it mean to forget?  NO.  You  can’t do some kind of mental gymnastics and erase the hurt from your  memory bank.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t mean minimizing the hurt or justifying the other person’s  actions.  Forgiveness doesn’t mean you pretend the hurt didn’t happen.\r\n\r\nForgiveness is relinquishing my right to hurt you for hurting me.   It’s releasing you from my judgment and releasing you to God’s justice.   It is making the choice to let the person off the hook, to not charge  the offense to their account.  It’s letting go of my RIGHT to get even.   Letting it go is an act of the will, it’s not a warm feeling!  Letting  go means releasing the offender from any obligation!  It’s releasing  yourself from re-living the hurts.\r\n\r\nPaul tells us to: “Make allowance for each other''s faults, forgive  anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must  forgive others.” (Colossians 3:13)\r\n\r\nSome of you are thinking, “No way.  You don’t know what they’ve done –  You don’t know the destruction they caused.”  In this moment,  everything in your spirit recoils at the thought of “giving them a free  pass” or releasing them from your judgment.\r\n\r\nYou have a choice.  You can carry it to your grave – or you can let  it go.  Life is too short.  It’s poisoning your soul.  Step back and  choose to let it go.  For some this feels like the hardest thing you’ve  ever been asked to do.  And in fact it may be – but, I’m asking you to  take the risk – trust the Lord and let it go.\r\n\r\nAs if that isn’t hard enough, I want to challenge you to bless those  who have hurt you.  Listen to what Jesus says: “But I tell you who hear  me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who  curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.” (Luke 6:27-28)\r\n\r\nA few verses later in verses 35-36, Jesus says, “Love your enemies,  do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything  back.  Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most  High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.  Be merciful,  just as your Father is merciful.” (Luke 6:35-36)\r\n\r\nThere’s a passage near the end of the book of Job.  You know the  story.  Satan bets God, that Job will turn away and hate God if Job life  gets hard.  Satan is allowed to take everything from Job but his life.   He lost his wealth; his servants, his health, and all of his children  were killed.  Job is devastated and he is left trying to figure out what  God is up to.  At times, he is angry, confused, and depressed.  At  times, he struggles with his faith.  Most of the book records of Job’s  conversations with three “friends.”   These friends tell Job “the reason  you are suffering is because of some sin in your life.”\r\n\r\nFinally, after 38 chapters of silence God speaks.  One of the things  God does is rebuke Job’s friends.  They had it all wrong.  All of this  came on Job not because of sin but rather because he was the most  righteous man on earth.  Between Job and these men, there has been no  love lost. Their words have penetrated and stung.\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets interesting.  God tells Job to pray for his  friends.  God is using this as a way to rebuild their relationship.\r\n\r\nIn Job 42:10 it says, “The Lord restored the fortunes of Job, when he  had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job twice as much as he  had before.”  This doesn’t mean that if you pray for your enemies that  you will win the lottery.  But, there is a valid principle here.  When  we are forgiving and pray for those who have hurt us, we will be  blessed.\r\n\r\nSo, how about it?  Will you choose to celebrate how much you have  been forgiven?  Will you choose to liberate those who have hurt you?\r\n\r\nBefore we wrap this up, I want to leave you with a word of warning that also comes from our story.  If you don’t forgive, you…\r\n\r\nRelease yourself to torture – Devastate\r\n\r\nListen to these harsh words.  “Then the king called in the man he had  forgiven and said, ‘You evil servant!  I forgave you that tremendous  debt because you pleaded with me.  Shouldn''t you have mercy on your  fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?’  Then the king sent the man  to prison until he had paid every penny.” (Matthew 18:32-34)\r\n\r\nJesus concludes the story in verse 35 with these words: “This is how  my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your  brother from your heart.” (Matthew 18:35)\r\n\r\nThese are some of the most troubling words in the Bible.  There are a lot of people who don’t take Jesus’ words seriously.\r\n\r\nHarboring bitterness and embracing resentment is like taking poison  into your body.  It always hurts you more than the person you are bitter  towards.  Your resentment will not change the past and will not solve  the problems of today.  It will rob you of joy and allows the other  person to continue to control you.  Unforgiveness eats you up on the  inside.  We all know people who are tortured by their unforgiving  spirit.\r\n\r\nBitterness will cause your heart to shrivel and grow hard.  It can  make you negative and critical.  And, it can become all-consuming.   That’s why the writer of Hebrews gives us this challenge. “See to it  that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to  cause trouble and defile many.” (Hebrews 12:15)\r\n\r\nSomeone has to break the cycle.  Someone has to have the courage to  say enough is enough.  Stop the insanity and destruction.  All we will  gain is bitterness toward each other.\r\n\r\nIt’s time for some of you to speak up and to say “enough.”  It’s time  to say the words “I forgive you.”  “I release you from my judgment.”   It’s time to put down the rock.\r\n\r\nWhen you come up for communion, you will have the opportunity to “put  down the rock”. You can put it in the basket.  Now is the time to “let  it go”.\r\n\r\nIn light of how much we’ve been forgiven, how can we do anything else?', 'Live Like You Were Dying - 4.

(270, 1, '2010-10-25 12:57:41', '2010-10-25 17:57:41', 'A Small History of the Church of Our Redeemer\r\n  			Aldie, Virginia\r\n\r\n In 1850 the Aldie Episcopalians, who previously had been Members of the Cameron and Shelbourne Parishes, separated from them and joined Meade Parish.  In 1853 Meade Parish was divided into two parts.  The eastern half was organized as Johns Parish, taking its name from the Reverend John Johns, the 4th bishop of Virginia.  The new parish included the towns of Upperville, Middleburg and Aldie with the rectory located in Upperville.\r\n\r\n In 1885 the parish was again reorganized, excluding Upperville but including Oatlands. In 1945 Johns Parish was to consist of Middleburg’s Emmanuel and Aldie’s Church of Our Redeemer. Oatlands became an independent church.\r\n\r\n There was no Episcopal church Building in Aldie before 1890, and services had been held in the Union Church on the site of today’s Presbyterian Church.  In 1849, that town lot and the building erected thereon were transferred to trustees, John Moore, Thomas Boyle, Robert Ish and William Rawlings for these purposes:  the building to be used as a place of public worship free to Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians, and the lot to be appropriated for and used exclusively as a graveyard.\r\n \r\n While there are no plans and pictures of the original building, it is believed to have been built of brick (probably burned on site) in the same style and possibly of the same size as historic Mt. Zion Church just east of Aldie on Route 50.  The free Church, located, naturally on Aldie’s Meeting House Lane, was sold to the trustees of the Presbyterian Church for the sum of five dollars in 1892.  By then the other denominations had built and moved into churches of their own.					\r\n\r\n														\r\n                                                                                                             1\r\n It was during this time that vestry records of Redeemer were sparsely kept, and indeed, the church was not known as Our Redeemer until it was so named in 1890.  Parishioner Henry Fairfax then owner of Oak Hill, the former estate of President James Monroe who retired to Loudoun County after his White House years, decided that Aldie needed an Episcopal church for its congregation from that village and nearby areas.  Mr. Fairfax and his neighbors, though already pew-holders and contributors at Emmanuel, would build one.\r\n\r\n The word was long handed down that the church was built entirely at Mr. Fairfax’s expense, and possibly so, but we know that his brother, Hamilton Rogers Fairfax of New York donated the pine and walnut pews, also the chancel furniture including the pulpit and lectern, that Vestryman John  Moore had installed the lovely stained glass window above the altar as a memorial to his wife Lucy Berkeley Moore, and that many of the other church furnishings were placed there by the Moore and diZerega families who figured largely in Redeemer’s early history.  However else the little white clapboard church came about, we know that Henry Fairfax deeded a plot of land on the southwest corner of his Oak Hill property fronting on the Little River Turnpike to Johns Parish and the Church of Our Redeemer came into existence.  We have only one pinpoint to its building date.  In the “Enterprise” column of the Loudoun Mirror, an early Loudoun County newspaper was found this item: \r\n\r\nALDIE VA., June 24, 1890.  “Our Episcopal friends have recently completed a very neat church in Aldie and expect to open it for service early in July.”\r\n\r\n The columnist known only as “Observer” also mentioned that the Little River Baptist Church would be dedicated the next Sunday, holding services all the day and the Saturday before.\r\n\r\n In the style of the time, Our Redeemer sat firmly on its stone foundation, its steep roof cover a 30’ by 47’ rectangular sanctuary with ribbed vaulted ceiling.  The interior, narthex doors, and windows followed a much-modified gothic design, all so simple as to warrant its being “a small country church” which, indeed, it has been ever since, despite its somewhat elegant furnishings.  While the building itself reflects the area, the furnishings reflect the Victorian era in which it was built.  Brass, carved walnut, cut glass, ornate silver and a marble font are still being enhanced by stained glass and needlepoint.\r\n\r\n When the new Parish House was being designed in 1997, the most important feature to the congregation was that it be architecturally compatible with the present church building, keeping the Moore window completely intact.  That this was done warrants tribute not only to today’s planners and builders but to the tastes and talents of our founding fathers.\r\n\r\n In its earliest days, whether Johns Parish Episcopalians met for worship in the free churches of Aldie or Middleburg, at Emmanuel, or finally at Our Redeemer, they followed the low- church ritual.  Because of their life-styles---farmers, millers, a few statesmen, wheelwrights, or small businessmen, --- the vestries chose not to stress those high-church traditions of more sophisticated parishes.  It was not until the early nineteen seventies that low-church ritual at Our Redeemer began subtly changing.  New prayer books, even new hymnals, the open-mindedness of bishops and the willingness of our ministers and congregations to accept change paved the way toward a more ecumenical attitude, thus more formal ritual.\r\n\r\n In the forties, except for kneeling to pray and following the prayer book, the service at Our Redeemer was the same as in any other Aldie church.  In fact, the only Sunday school in town was at the Presbyterian Church and some Episcopal members went there at 10:30 after 9:30 Redeemer services.  With change from low- church happening so slowly, it was easy to accept the processional cross, elevation of elements, and assistance of lay people---all things that make up our present service.  Learning to follow the newly styled bulletin and to sing the canticles in the new hymnal was much more difficult!\r\n	\r\n Some other changes in our times:  Until the seventies no woman had ever served on the vestry.  During the Rev. Neale Morgan’s tenure as pastor, a number of Our Redeemer women members were elected to that august office, and many have followed.  Helen Wallace served as the first woman Senior Warden, and Worthy Caulk as the first woman Junior Warden of Our Redeemer.\r\n	\r\n Through the years, a woman of the church were always the church organists, but since 1992 a man, John Gardecki, has taken his place at the console of our present pipe organ, given to the church by Deborah Kaylor in memory of her grandfathers, both musicians in the nineteenth century.  Redeemer has been blessed with ministers who could sing while the congregation joined in because it was a good and joyful thing to do.  Today a finely outfitted choir joins the dedicated organist in making music come alive in the church.\r\n	\r\n The history of Redeemer’s Sunday school goes back to its church beginnings when the children from the Oak Hill vicinity were driven across the fields in a pony cart by the Fairfax’s English governess, Redeemer’s first Sunday school teacher, to be met there by other children of the village.\r\n	\r\n There were years, however, when services were sparsely attended, and Sunday school not at all.  In 1950 came the request from the Women’s Auxiliary (church ladies were known as such then) that Our Redeemer have an all-purpose room suitable for Sunday school, meetings, suppers and bible school.  It was built—and a bank loan for it was paid back fully with a minimum of sacrifice but maximum effort.\r\n\r\n Vestrymen and village friends with know-how were resident engineers, contractors, and bankers.  The women of the church helped plan the moneymaking events:  Aldie old homes tours complete with plantation luncheon at Stoke, antique sales at Mercer and Berkeley houses, and the Church’s own harvest festival.  By this time the women had become more than church housekeepers and gardeners, supper organizers and Sunday school teachers. The all purpose room, constructed beneath the original church building, added 1000 ft of usable space at a cost of $8,086.31.\r\n\r\n Mrs. Henry Fairfax long outlived her husband who had been Our Redeemer’s guardian angel until his death in 1916.  For most of her years Eugenia Tennant Fairfax was a source of any information on Our Redeemer.  We quote as we remember: “Mr. Fairfax gave the land; the money for building the Episcopal Church was raised entirely by Mr. Fairfax and Captain diZerega who lived in the Mercer house.  Mr. Norris was the architect and Mr. Ambler was the builder, along with Mr. Watson.”  There was no mention anywhere of cost.  Mrs. Fairfax did say, however, that when church money was needed for any purpose, it came from the collection plates or from the goodness of parishioners’ hearts.  Pass the hat, as it were.\r\n  	\r\n From the Resolution of Memoriam by the vestry on his death: “the Hon. Henry Fairfax was a man prominent in the affairs of State and Nation but not withstanding the wide range of his interests…he kept alive an active interest in his home county and his church…always ready to do his part which would be helpful in the moral and spiritual betterment of the community in which he lived.”\r\n	\r\n Our Redeemer was very lucky to have been on the receiving end of the devotion of Henry and “Miss Eugie” Fairfax. After they purchased and moved to the old Rogers plantation west of Aldie, named “Oakham”, where Mr. Fairfax raised champion trotting horses, Oak Hill plantation passed into the hands of Mr. Frank Littleton.  It was then purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas DeLashmutt.   In1956 the DeLashmutt’s deeded land for a parking lot around Redeemer which was enlarged by yet a third gift of land from Oak Hill in 1997 when current owners, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas DeLashmutt,  Jr. donated enough acreage to more than double the parking space needed for the Parish Hall project begun in March of that year.\r\n	\r\n It is a notable fact that most of the rectors and vestries kept excellent parishioner records during the early years of Johns Parish, and before, from 1840-1853 in Meade Parish by the Reverends Slaughter, Jackson, and Wilmer.  The notes of Johns Parish were furnished intact until 1889 by the Reverends Kinsolving, Dame, Maury, Johnson, Johns and Ambler, giving names and dates for those Episcopalians who were born, baptized, confirmed, communicants, married and buried in the Parish, listed as either Middleburg or Aldie members.\r\n	\r\n Middleburg had built its own church in 1843, another “very neat and convenient” brick church given the Hebrew name of “Immanuel” according to Bishop John Johns who consecrated it.\r\n	\r\n Emmanuel also built a rectory on a near-by lot but they rented it out as a residence rather than using it themselves because the rectors who served the three charges of Middleburg, Aldie and Oatlands preferred to live halfway between them.  Aldie was chosen despite the leaking roof that had come with the former Mt. Zion Baptist rectory purchased by the Episcopalians.\r\n	\r\n The Aldie rectory was the meeting place of the combined vestries, as we have noted, but otherwise there is no telling what happened at those meetings.  Regardless of the beautiful penmanship in which the minutes were written, most of them are impossible.\r\n\r\n  It is believed, however, that excepting costs and payments --- distributions thereof ---electing vestrymen (many of whom served for years at a time), writing resolutions of appreciation and voting on the property repairs (eternally ongoing) plus electing representatives to various church conventions, nothing much of interest came about.  Though, while laboriously proceeding through vestry records from 1853-1921, many items of value did emerge.  In some instances these items were copied without reserve from the Rev. Richard H. Wilmer (1849-1852) who found no register upon taking charge of Meade Parish and merely recorded such facts in relation to the Parish prior to his rector ship as he has been able to glean from others.  One hundred and fifty years later this “small history” gatherer understands that perfectly.\r\n	\r\n  In 1853-1870, while the Rev. Kinsolving was in charge, Johns Parish was organized.  A Civil War had also raged through the land.  Births and deaths of those at home had been recorded.  We know that Aldie’s Free Church had become a hospital as had many homes of communicants who lived near area battlefields.  Dover and Aldie Mills were among the grist mills along Little River, which, used to grinding grain for neighboring farmers, turned to furnishing food for the Confederate, and in many instances, the Union Army.  Young sons of the Parish went off to war; the Rev. Kinsolving himself was taken to prison --- perhaps because of earlier secession sermons.\r\n	\r\n  Aldie became known as “a hornet’s hive.”  General J.E.B. Stuart, Col. John Mosby, and Aldie vestryman William N. Noland who formed Champe Rifles, all became Turnpike heroes. But there was no mention of the Civil War in the minutes of the vestry of either church.  There was few worship services held during the war.  The vestries did duly meet at the Aldie directory, usually on Sunday afternoons, but only to elect new members or reinstall old ones.  After 1865 the Aldie Episcopalians continued their worship at the Free Church in Middleburg which still welcomes them to its homecoming each year on the second Sunday in June.\r\n	\r\n  In 1877, then Rector William Johnson pleaded with the vestries to give consideration to his ideas of having communicants make an annual pledge to the church which they could pay through monthly installments put into the Sunday collection plates.  They did --- and we still do.   Pledge Sunday is the first Sunday in November.\r\n	\r\n  So---very little that we can see from the records happened in Johns Parish from the period following the Civil --- or War Between the States --- until 1903 when the Rev. Thomas C. Darst took charge of Johns Parish.  He wrote, “There was no evidence to show that the minutes of form in Aldie Vestry Meetings had been recorded.”\r\n	\r\n  During that cut-off period of information one very important thing did happen, however.  The Church of Our Redeemer was built and in 1903 the following vestry was elected: Henry Fairfax, John D. Moore, Littleton Turner, J. Thomas Watson, Edward Wilson, Parker Wilson, Alfred L. B. diZerega joined the vestry the following year.  The entire membership was of Aldie residents joining the long list of Aldie names like Berkeley, Adams, McVeigh, Noland, Oden, Carter, Harris --- who since the beginning had been part of Aldie’s church.  Goode, Tyler, Hutchison…\r\n	\r\n  From then on the Redeemer records are complete, although factually spare in some years: During World War I there were only quarterly vestry meetings; during World War II funds were at such a low ebb it was difficult to keep up necessary payments; vestries cut back on all but war-time emergencies. Parishioners and their personal church records are duly noted, (housed now in our new Parish House library.)  Many family names have been added through the years while many more have sadly been subtracted.\r\n	\r\n  Aldie remained a small rural town, its residents involved mainly in farming, milling, carriage and wagon building and store-keeping until not too many years ago when Route 50 allowed for better transportation into the government centers in Washington.  The Mercer-planned canal from Alexandria to Aldie did not ever get built, but Charles Fenton Mercer who founded the village left many good reminders of his life in his corner of Virginia when he was legislator and U.S. Congressman, a pusher for roads and free education.  As his village and its environment grows and changes, so does the Church of Our Redeemer.\r\n	\r\n  In 1995 there came the biggest change of all.  The Churches of Johns Parish became unyoked, each going its separate way in its ministry while remaining a part of the same parish.  Until then Emmanuel and Our Redeemer had shared the same rector --- and there must be a word here about some of those who since 1921 have pastured Aldie’s flock.\r\n	\r\n  The Rev. David Campbell Mayers --- lived in Aldie’s Rectory and was a pillar of the entire community, even joining with his wife in 1923 the Aldie Horticultural Society, founded to beautify the village, to interest school children in horticulture and to grow bulbs for sale in city markets.  Rev. Mayers was a legend in his twenty-five year stint with Episcopalians of Aldie and Middleburg.\r\n	\r\n  As was the Rev. Ernest (Froggy) de Bordenave, 1955-1967, who goes down in our history as exceptionally well-loved.  An astute businessman (“He knew everybody so could talk anyone into lending us their house for Aldie’s Old Homes Tours.”)  He was highly respected as a town leader, and believer in equal rights between the races.  Froggy’s fearless stance on integration is one of our Parish’s proudest memories.\r\n												\r\n  S. Neale Morgan followed Froggy in his public spiritedness and support of justice for all.  During his years in Middleburg and Aldie (he first lived in the Rectory in Middleburg, then he and his wife Mary Ann built their own home in Aldie.) and the FISH organization --- a volunteer effort to buy and deliver food for the needy, help pay medical and utility bills and to drive those who need it to medical facilities.  Redeemer is active with FISH and it remains on the church list of outreach supports.  For another twenty-five years the Rev. Morgan was among us --- his sermons were superb.  He brought in ordained women as his assistants, and he brought about many other changes --- but so quietly one would never guess!\r\n	\r\n  Outreach funds come from one of the two Parish jointly supported activities of long-standing.  The Rummage Sale is held in May; its funds are contributed to various places that need financial help including Seven Loaves, Abused Women’s Shelter, the Aldie Fire Department, and the Bishops Fund for World Relief, etc.  The Christmas Shop will celebrate its 50th year in November, 1999.  It has grown in leaps and bounds through the boundless energy of the women of Johns Parish, and more recently, its men.  Funds from the Christmas Shop are divided among the two churches; they are shared with the Diocese, Charities, Episcopal missions overseas, and ecumenical outreach of the National Church.\r\n	\r\n  Our Redeemer’s own fundraiser - the Shrove Tuesday’s pancake supper help relieve the burden of the church treasury. Not for funds but for fun --- we have the Blessing of the Pets in October, and the Parish Picnic in August.\r\n\r\n	A small history cannot be complete without a calendar of events.\r\n	The Event celebrated in 1999 is the completion of the Parish House.  In 1995 it was the unyoking of the churches and Redeemer’s call to its very first own priest-in-large.  The Rev. Jane Wallace Barr accepted that call.  She is now our three-quarter time priest.\r\n	In a focus statement written by the vestry in 1995,m this family-sized multi-generational congregation had a vision:\r\n•	To expand the congregation’s size and to increase the number and variety of programs for worship, study and fellowship for children and adults.\r\n•	To rely to a greater extent on pledges to pay operational costs, devoting fund raising proceeds to outreach.\r\n•	More hands-on Congregational participation.\r\n•	To have a full-time Priest.\r\n•	To be a light in the community, providing a place of faith and fellowship for all.\r\n•	To promote spiritual growth and rejuvenation.\r\n•	To be a place where the Gospel is preached, and God glorified through the Savior, Jesus Christ.\r\n•	To build a Parish Hall to provide space for an office, Sunday School classrooms and fellowship activities.\r\nIn March, 1997, the Parish Hall plan was presented to the Congregation by the Building Committee.  It was accepted as a design that complemented the beautiful little church of Our Redeemer and its construction moved steadily onward.\r\n\r\n\r\nChancel furnishings given by Hamilton Rodgers Fairfax, 1896\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSanctuary lights given in memory of Mr. and Mrs. A.L.B. diZerega by their family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dark blue vaulted ceilings with walnut trusses denote the heavens; \r\nthe wall color denotes the air; the carpet color denotes the earth.  The\r\nstained glass windows speak of Our Redeemer’s links to its past and\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy Berkeley Moore\r\n  Memorial Stained\r\n   Glass Window	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnston Russell\r\nMemorial Stained\r\n   Glass Window	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone worked hard, dreamed and prayed for a building that is crucial to Redeemer’s future.  At every turn, on every hand, there seemed to be a Guardian Angel who helped Our Redeemer reach its goals.(After 110 years, could Henry Fairfax still be watching after the little church he’d built on the corner of his land?)\r\n\r\nThat those goals have been reached so quickly is almost a miracle in itself.  The Congregation believes it is blest, that God has been extremely good to us, that in the future we must continue to be His responsible stewards.\r\n\r\nRedeemer is on its way.  And one thing is certain:  Not one word has been left out of its current vestry and congregational reports; not one picture has been left un-taken.  When the next history of Redeemer is needed, it can be taken from the Internet!\r\n\r\n		\r\nA Note from the Author\r\n\r\nWhen I was asked by the Dedication Committee to prepare a small treatise on the history of Church of Our Redeemer, to be readied in a month’s time, it seemed simple to say “oh yes, I’d  like to do that.” After digging through every note and record I could find on Redeemer’s earliest years it is hereby highly recommended that Chet (Chester) Low’s excellent historical essay, written or the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the consecration of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Middleburg, be diligently read and studied.\r\n\r\nChet Low readily acknowledged that he had relied heavily on the already researched work by Loudoun historian Eugene Scheel, The History of Middleburg and Vicinity, for answers about his questions about John Parish, in particular, and the role of the Episcopal \r\nChurch in this area, in general, since 1843 when its ministry truly began outside Tidewater Virginia.\r\nIt is recommended that Scheel’s book also be studied by those interested in Loudoun-Fauquier history.  Between these two printed materials and the hand-written church records of Emmanuel and Our Redeemer churches we have an idea of how Redeemer came about --- and why we know it as the wonderful little church we love today.\r\n\r\n							Alworthy U.

The kneelers at the Altar rail were specially designed by Mrs. \r\nSharp to denote the little white church as a part of this rural countryside and its relationship to Oak Hill.  They \r\nare dedicated to the ministers, vestries, Altar Guilds, and organists who have served Our Redeemer.\r\n                Needlepoint cushions on the priest chairs were dedicated in 1997 in honor of the Rev. S.

Many of the\r\ntrees and shrubs were donated in memory of or in honor of a loved one, or cherished friend.\r\n	  A Friendship Garden will be a special feature of the new landscaping for the Church and Parish Hall.  A knot garden, designed by Lizbeth Prins, will feature rows of boxwood, in keeping with the older boxwood and perennial plantings.\r\n	  A crabapple tree and a barberry hedge given by the Tyler family and an apple tree planted for Our Redeemer by Bishop John Baden are among the horticultural treasures of the church.\r\n\r\nAltar Linens, Hangings, Hymnals and Prayer Books\r\n	  Altar Linens and hangings have been lovingly made by hand and given in memory of Our Redeemer communicants.  The hymnals and prayer books are all gifts to the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n												22\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Gifts\r\n\r\n	 One very hot summer, John Wallace put air conditioning in the church.  One Christmas, the Snyders gave colonial hurricane lamps to decorate the windows.  Interim rector Ted Johnson left Altar copies of the Gospel and Book of Common Prayer as gifts.\r\n	The beautiful patio appeared as if by magic.  The sign, the parking lot, the outdoor lighting, garden benches and a table, a library and whatever Our Redeemer needs just seems to come!\r\n\r\nParish Hall\r\n	The tradition of giving continues with the completion and September 26, 1999 dedication of the Parish Hall---what more can we ask.\r\n', 'Our History', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '243-revision-4', '', '', '2010-10-25 12:57:41', '2010-10-25 17:57:41', '', 243, 'http://doverknoll.com/aldiechurch/archives/270', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(Is it a story, a poem, a essay on theology?) How do you know?\r\n2. Why is it important to realize this is a poem? If you had imagined this to be, say, a set of commandments, how would you have read it differently? What would it have sounded like if you read it aloud? How would your "takeaway" have been different?\r\nOk - this is a Psalm, Psalm 51 to be precise. If I had told you that this was from the Book of Psalms right away, you probably would already have made some assumptions. First of all, ANYTHING in the book of Psalms is going to be the lyrics to a song. If you have a hymnal around, try just reading the words the words to some of your favorite hymns. I''m a sucker for ''How Great Thou Art.'' When we sing that, its hard not to enter into a certain kind of voice, because it is immediately apparent that we are talking about how BIG God is. When I sing, "Standing on the Promises," I feel solid. When I read the Psalms, its important to understand what I feel.\r\n\r\n3. So, how do you feel after reading this?\r\nWhen I read this, I can''t help but feel guilty. In verse 3 (and by the way, the whole point of verses is just to make it easier to see the text I''m referring to - so go back and look!) I think about how I feel when I sin. (Sadly, I get a lot of practice with that.) I hear the writer of this talking about his sin, and the same sense of inadequacies that I feel are the same things that I hear him saying. You may feel differently - but the whole point of a song or a poem is to feel, so whenever you read the Psalms, its OK (and in fact expected) that you do so with your feelings.\r\n\r\nBut, once you understand YOUR feelings, it''s good to go back and test those feelings against what is actually in the text. Something that annoys me more than just about anything is when some self-important buffoon reads something and thinks that all he needs to do is just react in some fashion. Anyone can react - the difference between a reader and a reactor is that the reader actually looks back at what is said to justify the claims he makes. So, go back and re-read the Psalm, and then answer these questions so you can make sure you are hearing what the writer said. Basically, whenever I read ANYTHING - especially the Bible, I''m going to go through a series of steps. First, I make sure I know what the text actually says. Then I ask myself what the point is that the author is trying to make, based on what the text says. Finally, I will evaluate that in terms of my own reaction. If I read Mein Kampf, for instance, it is very easy to say ''Adolf Hitler'' is a sick donkey - but I already knew that. The point would be to understand his argument first. He thinks that Jews are responsible for all his problems. If I stopped there, I will have understood him, and could at least intelligently discuss his work. But I don''t just want to blindly accept what the author says either. The point is to understand then evaluate. No, Jews aren''t responsible for his problems - his lack of willingness to take any responsibility for his own actions is!\r\n4. What does the writer say about what God thinks of sacrifices? (Along those lines, you can assume that the writer is Jewish because of the whole sacrifice thing. Why do you suppose the writer would even mention sacrifices if he is going to say that God doesn''t desire them?)\r\n5. In v12, the author says, ''Restore unto me'' ... what? What is missing when he sins?\r\n6. So, he uses the words "joy of my salvation." What is joy? Is it the same thing as happiness? Can sin make you happy? (If you answered ''No,'' you have a very hard argument to make!) Can sin make you joyful? Does doing the right thing always make you happy? But, is there a sense of joy that can come with it? (Notice how by closely reading the text, you are naturally led down a path that makes you think deeply about seemingly simple concepts. When we get to what Paul writes, this is a VERY important skill.)\r\n7. Clearly the writer has committed some kind of sin. Against whom does he say he sinned? (Hint: v4) What sin did he commit? (Hint: v14) Does there seem like a potential conflict here?\r\n======\r\nNow just a little bit of background on the writer. If you find a Bible and look up Psalm 51, you''re going to find out who the author is. No surprise here, it''s King David. Imagine if George Washington had been a songwriter, and you''ll get an idea of what most Jews reading this Psalm probably felt. What makes the Jews - and hence the Bible - unique in their time, however, is that they were willing to explore the less than perfect side of their heroes. The Egyptians, Assyrians, or all the other empires at this time would not have cast their hero as having faults. For us, the implication is that honest, genuine feeling is desirable.\r\nLet''s try to answer question 7 by delving into the history. We''ll be working through 2 Sam 11 &amp; 12, the history that most scholars say is the background for Psalm 51. Before we read, however, another question: 8. How is reading a history different than reading a poem? And, in either case, how is reading either a poem or a story different than say, a list of commandments and laws?\r\n9. Just for chuckles, what percentage of the Bible do you think is actually legal in nature? (i.e. what portion of the Bible would be best characterized as a set of commandments in the form ''Thou Shalt...'' or ''Thou Shalt Not...'') Where in the Bible do you think you find such\r\ntexts? If you think it is a large percentage, what does that say about the God who would have put together such a Bible? If you think it is a smaller percentage, same question...\r\n10. When you read a history, what tools are you using to "get meaning" from it?\r\n11. So, what did David do here that would be called sin?\r\n12. Why won''t Uriah sleep with his wife? What does that say about his character? Go back to 11.1 - Can the same be said of the great King David?\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2 Samuel 11:1 In the spring of the year, when kings normally go out to war, David sent Joab and the Israelite army to fight the Ammonites. They destroyed the Ammonite army and laid siege to the city of Rabbah. However, David stayed behind in Jerusalem. 2 Late one afternoon, after his midday rest, David got out of bed and was walking on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath. 3 He sent someone to find out who she was, and he was told, "She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite." 4 Then David sent messengers to get her; and when she came to the palace, he slept with her. She had just completed the purification rites after having her menstrual period. Then she returned home. 5 Later, when Bathsheba discovered that she was pregnant, she sent David a message, saying, "I''m pregnant."\r\n6 Then David sent word to Joab: "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent him to David. 7 When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was progressing. 8 Then he told Uriah, "Go on home and relax. " David even sent a gift to Uriah after he had left the palace. 9 But Uriah didn''t go home. He slept that night at the palace entrance with the king''s palace guard. 10 When David heard that Uriah had not gone home, he summoned him and asked, "What''s the matter? Why didn''t you go home last night after being away for so long?" 11 Uriah replied, "The Ark and the armies of Israel and Judah are living in tents, and Joab and my master''s men are camping in the open fields. How could I go home to wine and dine and sleep with my wife? I swear that I would never do such a thing." 12 "Well, stay here today," David told him, "and tomorrow you may return to the army." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 13 Then David invited him to dinner and got him drunk. But even then he couldn''t get Uriah to go home to his wife. Again he slept at the palace entrance with the king''s palace guard.\r\n14 So the next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and gave it to Uriah to deliver. 15 The letter instructed Joab, "Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest. Then pull back so that he will be killed." 16 So Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall where he knew the enemy''s strongest men were fighting. 17 And when the enemy soldiers came out of the city to fight, Uriah the Hittite was killed along with several other Israelite</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">13. How did David "fix" his problem?\r\n14. Go back to Psalm 51 for a minute. So, we can add murder (even treason?) to the sins of adultery here. Did David have the legal right to have Uriah killed? (Remember he was the King!) Does this at least explain why David could say what he did? In general, whenever I see what looks like a contradiction in the Bible, my first instinct is to see if there is more information that could explain apparent contradictions...\r\n15. Even if you can explain the 51.4/14 conflict, however, what do you think of David''s actions?\r\n====\r\nOkay, stop for a minute and reflect. It sounds like David is about ready to get away with this, right? It''s important to feel that as you experience this story. How do you feel thinking that David has seemingly committed murder and adultery against an otherwise loyal soldier?\r\nLet''s keep reading:\r\n2 Samuel 12:1†? So the LORD sent Nathan the prophet to tell David this story: "There were two men in a certain town. One was rich, and one was poor. 2 The rich man owned a great many sheep and cattle. 3 The poor man owned nothing but one little lamb he had bought. He raised that little lamb, and it grew up with his children. It ate from the man''s own plate and drank from his cup. He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter. 4 One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man. But instead of killing an animal from his own flock or herd, he took the poor man''s lamb and killed it and prepared it for his guest." 5 David was furious. "As surely as the LORD lives," he vowed, "any man who would do such a thing deserves to die! 6 He must repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity."\r\nsoldiers. 18 Then Joab sent a battle report to David. 19 He told his messenger, "Report all the news of the battle to the king. 20 But he might get angry and ask, ''Why did the troops go so close to the city? Didn''t they know there would be shooting from the walls? 21 Wasn''t Abimelech son of Gideon killed at Thebez by a woman who threw a millstone down on him from the wall? Why would you get so close to the wall?'' Then tell him, ''Uriah the Hittite was killed, too.'' " 22 So the messenger went to Jerusalem and gave a complete report to David. 23 "The enemy came out against us in the open fields," he said. "And as we chased them back to the city gate, 24 the archers on the wall shot arrows at us. Some of the king''s men were killed, including Uriah the Hittite." 25 "Well, tell Joab not to be discouraged," David said. "The sword devours this one today and that one tomorrow! Fight harder next time, and conquer the city!" 26 When Uriah''s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. 27 When the period of mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to the palace, and she became one of his wives. Then she gave birth to a son. But the LORD was displeased with what David had done.</p>\r\n16. So, what does this Nathan guy do? Why do you suppose he tells this story? Now for the punch line. Read this loud and bold:\r\nOkay, stop for a minute. Imagine you are Nathan. What are you feeling as you say this? What could happen to him? Also, imagine David. What do you suppose his reaction is? Why can Nathan get away with this? Why does Nathan say that David has "despised" the Word of the Lord (v9?)\r\nBy the way, does it really matter who the Ammonites are? (Answer: NO.) I ask this to sort of tell you that nine times out of ten, the historical details usually aren''t THAT important. If they are, pretty much any decent commentary will alert you the fact. I can tell you that Ammonites are basically just another set of people next to Israel with whom they are often at war... Move along, nothing to see here...\r\nOkay - 17. How does David react? 18. How does God (through Nathan) react? 19. Does this seem fair? 20. Then why does God do it? 21. Can you see how this would inform the desire for forgiveness, as per Psalm 51?\r\nGo back and look at the end of Psalm 51 again. Any new insight? Finally, let''s just see how the story ends:\r\n†? Then Nathan said to David, "You are that man!\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The LORD, the God of Israel, says: I anointed you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul. 8 I gave you your master''s house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more. 9 Why, then, have you despised the word of the LORD and done this horrible deed? For you have murdered Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites and stolen his wife. 10 From this time on, your family will live by the sword because you have despised me by taking Uriah''s wife to be your own. 11 "This is what the LORD says: Because of what you have done, I will cause your own household to rebel against you. I will give your wives to another man before your very eyes, and he will go to bed with them in public view. 12 You did it secretly, but I will make this happen to you openly in the sight of all Israel."\r\n13 Then David confessed to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan replied, "Yes, but the LORD has forgiven you, and you won''t die for this sin. 14 Nevertheless, because you have shown utter contempt for the LORD by doing this, your child will die."\r\n15†? After Nathan returned to his home, the LORD sent a deadly illness to the child of David and Uriah''s wife. 16 David begged God to spare the child. He went without food and lay all night on the bare ground. 17 The elders of  his household pleaded with him to get up and eat with them, but he  refused. 18 Then on the seventh day the child died. David''s advisers  were afraid to tell him. "He wouldn''t listen to reason while the child  was ill," they said. "What drastic thing will he do when we tell him the  child is dead?" 19 When David saw them whispering, he realized what had  happened. "Is the child dead?" he asked."Yes," they replied, "he is  dead." 20 Then David got up from the ground, washed himself, put on  lotions, and changed his clothes. He went to the Tabernacle and  worshiped the LORD. After that, he returned to the palace and was served  food and ate. 21 His advisers were amazed. "We don''t understand you,"  they told him. "While the child was still living, you wept and refused  to eat. But now that the child is dead, you have stopped your mourning  and are eating again." 22 David replied, "I fasted and wept while the  child was alive, for I said, ''Perhaps the LORD will be gracious to me  and let the child live.'' 23 But why should I fast when he is dead? Can I  bring him back again? I will go to him one day, but he cannot return to  me." 24†? Then David comforted Bathsheba, his wife, and slept with her.  She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and they named him  Solomon. The LORD loved the child 25 and sent word through Nathan the  prophet that they should name him Jedidiah (which means "beloved of the  LORD"), as the LORD had commanded.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n22. Does David really get off scot-free?\r\n\r\nNow, as men it''s worth asking ourselves some application questions.\r\n\r\n1. Does it seem manly to admit you''re wrong? How so or Why not?\r\n\r\n2. Is it harder for us to "feel" our faith?\r\n\r\n3. Was there a lack of accountability in David? Is that why he sinned? Could that could be present in us?\r\n\r\n4. What is the "joy of our salvation?"\r\nWe''ll discuss some of this when we get together on Sunday.

If you think it is a large percentage, what does that say about the God who would have put together such a Bible? If you think it is a smaller percentage, same question...\n10. When you read a history, what tools are you using to "get meaning" from it?\n11. So, what did David do here that would be called sin?\n12. Why won''t Uriah sleep with his wife? What does that say about his character? Go back to 11.1 - Can the same be said of the great King David?\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2 Samuel 11:1 In the spring of the year, when kings normally go out to war, David sent Joab and the Israelite army to fight the Ammonites. They destroyed the Ammonite army and laid siege to the city of Rabbah. However, David stayed behind in Jerusalem. 2 Late one afternoon, after his midday rest, David got out of bed and was walking on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath. 3 He sent someone to find out who she was, and he was told, "She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite." 4 Then David sent messengers to get her; and when she came to the palace, he slept with her. She had just completed the purification rites after having her menstrual period. Then she returned home. 5 Later, when Bathsheba discovered that she was pregnant, she sent David a message, saying, "I''m pregnant."\n6 Then David sent word to Joab: "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent him to David. 7 When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was progressing. 8 Then he told Uriah, "Go on home and relax. " David even sent a gift to Uriah after he had left the palace. 9 But Uriah didn''t go home. He slept that night at the palace entrance with the king''s palace guard. 10 When David heard that Uriah had not gone home, he summoned him and asked, "What''s the matter? Why didn''t you go home last night after being away for so long?" 11 Uriah replied, "The Ark and the armies of Israel and Judah are living in tents, and Joab and my master''s men are camping in the open fields. How could I go home to wine and dine and sleep with my wife? I swear that I would never do such a thing." 12 "Well, stay here today," David told him, "and tomorrow you may return to the army." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 13 Then David invited him to dinner and got him drunk. But even then he couldn''t get Uriah to go home to his wife. Again he slept at the palace entrance with the king''s palace guard.\n14 So the next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and gave it to Uriah to deliver. 15 The letter instructed Joab, "Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest. Then pull back so that he will be killed." 16 So Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall where he knew the enemy''s strongest men were fighting. 17 And when the enemy soldiers came out of the city to fight, Uriah the Hittite was killed along with several other Israelite</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">13. How did David "fix" his problem?\n14. Go back to Psalm 51 for a minute. So, we can add murder (even treason?) to the sins of adultery here. Did David have the legal right to have Uriah killed? (Remember he was the King!) Does this at least explain why David could say what he did? In general, whenever I see what looks like a contradiction in the Bible, my first instinct is to see if there is more information that could explain apparent contradictions...\n15. Even if you can explain the 51.4/14 conflict, however, what do you think of David''s actions?\n====\nOkay, stop for a minute and reflect. It sounds like David is about ready to get away with this, right? It''s important to feel that as you experience this story. How do you feel thinking that David has seemingly committed murder and adultery against an otherwise loyal soldier?\nLet''s keep reading:\n2 Samuel 12:1†? So the LORD sent Nathan the prophet to tell David this story: "There were two men in a certain town. One was rich, and one was poor. 2 The rich man owned a great many sheep and cattle. 3 The poor man owned nothing but one little lamb he had bought. He raised that little lamb, and it grew up with his children. It ate from the man''s own plate and drank from his cup. He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter. 4 One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man. But instead of killing an animal from his own flock or herd, he took the poor man''s lamb and killed it and prepared it for his guest." 5 David was furious. "As surely as the LORD lives," he vowed, "any man who would do such a thing deserves to die! 6 He must repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity."\nsoldiers. 18 Then Joab sent a battle report to David. 19 He told his messenger, "Report all the news of the battle to the king. 20 But he might get angry and ask, ''Why did the troops go so close to the city? Didn''t they know there would be shooting from the walls? 21 Wasn''t Abimelech son of Gideon killed at Thebez by a woman who threw a millstone down on him from the wall? Why would you get so close to the wall?'' Then tell him, ''Uriah the Hittite was killed, too.'' " 22 So the messenger went to Jerusalem and gave a complete report to David. 23 "The enemy came out against us in the open fields," he said. "And as we chased them back to the city gate, 24 the archers on the wall shot arrows at us. Some of the king''s men were killed, including Uriah the Hittite." 25 "Well, tell Joab not to be discouraged," David said. "The sword devours this one today and that one tomorrow! Fight harder next time, and conquer the city!" 26 When Uriah''s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. 27 When the period of mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to the palace, and she became one of his wives. Then she gave birth to a son. But the LORD was displeased with what David had done.</p>\n16. So, what does this Nathan guy do? Why do you suppose he tells this story? Now for the punch line. Read this loud and bold:\nOkay, stop for a minute. Imagine you are Nathan. What are you feeling as you say this? What could happen to him? Also, imagine David. What do you suppose his reaction is? Why can Nathan get away with this? Why does Nathan say that David has "despised" the Word of the Lord (v9?)\nBy the way, does it really matter who the Ammonites are? (Answer: NO.) I ask this to sort of tell you that nine times out of ten, the historical details usually aren''t THAT important. If they are, pretty much any decent commentary will alert you the fact. I can tell you that Ammonites are basically just another set of people next to Israel with whom they are often at war... Move along, nothing to see here...\nOkay - 17. How does David react? 18. How does God (through Nathan) react? 19. Does this seem fair? 20. Then why does God do it? 21. Can you see how this would inform the desire for forgiveness, as per Psalm 51?\nGo back and look at the end of Psalm 51 again. Any new insight? Finally, let''s just see how the story ends:\n†? Then Nathan said to David, "You are that man!\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The LORD, the God of Israel, says: I anointed you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul. 8 I gave you your master''s house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more. 9 Why, then, have you despised the word of the LORD and done this horrible deed? For you have murdered Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites and stolen his wife. 10 From this time on, your family will live by the sword because you have despised me by taking Uriah''s wife to be your own. 11 "This is what the LORD says: Because of what you have done, I will cause your own household to rebel against you. I will give your wives to another man before your very eyes, and he will go to bed with them in public view. 12 You did it secretly, but I will make this happen to you openly in the sight of all Israel."\n13 Then David confessed to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan replied, "Yes, but the LORD has forgiven you, and you won''t die for this sin. 14 Nevertheless, because you have shown utter contempt for the LORD by doing this, your child will die."\n15†? After Nathan returned to his home, the LORD sent a deadly illness to the child of David and Uriah''s wife. 16 David begged God to spare the child. He went without food and lay all night on the bare ground. 17 The elders of  his household pleaded with him to get up and eat with them, but he  refused. 18 Then on the seventh day the child died. David''s advisers  were afraid to tell him. "He wouldn''t listen to reason while the child  was ill," they said. "What drastic thing will he do when we tell him the  child is dead?" 19 When David saw them whispering, he realized what had  happened. "Is the child dead?" he asked."Yes," they replied, "he is  dead." 20 Then David got up from the ground, washed himself, put on  lotions, and changed his clothes. He went to the Tabernacle and  worshiped the LORD. After that, he returned to the palace and was served  food and ate. 21 His advisers were amazed. "We don''t understand you,"  they told him. "While the child was still living, you wept and refused  to eat. But now that the child is dead, you have stopped your mourning  and are eating again." 22 David replied, "I fasted and wept while the  child was alive, for I said, ''Perhaps the LORD will be gracious to me  and let the child live.'' 23 But why should I fast when he is dead? Can I  bring him back again? I will go to him one day, but he cannot return to  me." 24†? Then David comforted Bathsheba, his wife, and slept with her.  She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and they named him  Solomon. The LORD loved the child 25 and sent word through Nathan the  prophet that they should name him Jedidiah (which means "beloved of the  LORD"), as the LORD had commanded.</p>\n\n\n22. Does David really get off scot-free?\n\nNow, as men it''s worth asking ourselves some application questions.\n\n1. Does it seem manly to admit you''re wrong? How so or Why not?\n\n2. Is it harder for us to "feel" our faith?\n\n3. Was there a lack of accountability in David? Is that why he sinned? Could that could be present in us?\n\n4. What is the "joy of our salvation?"\nWe''ll discuss some of this when we get together on Sunday.

As you’re reading, please ask yourself a few questions, like: What kind of text am I reading? What is the desired outcome? What kind of people wrote this?\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">\r\nAll passenger motor vehicle carriers, operating under the provisions of chapter one hundred sixty-one-a of the Code of Virginia, shall separate the white and colored passengers in their motor buses and set apart and designate in each bus or other vehicle, a portion thereof or certain seats therein, to be occupied by white passengers, and a portion thereof or certain seats therein, to be occupied by colored passengers, and such company or corporation, person or persons that shall fail, refuse, or neglect to comply with the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon indictment and conviction, shall be fined not less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred and fifty dollars for each offense.\r\nThe said companies, corporations, or persons so operating motor vehicle carriers shall make no difference or discrimination in the quality or convenience of the accommodations provided for the two races under the provisions of the preceding section.\r\nThe driver, operator, or other person in charge of any motor vehicle above mentioned shall have the right and is hereby directed and required at any time when it may be necessary or proper for the comfort and convenience of passengers so to do, to change the designation so as to increase or decrease the amount of space or seats set apart for either race; but no contiguous seats on the same bench shall be occupied by white and colored passengers at the same time; and said driver, operator or other person in charge of the vehicle may require any passenger to change his or her seat as it may be necessary or proper; the driver, operator, or other person in charge of said vehicle who shall fail or refuse to carry out provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not less than five dollars no more than twenty-five dollars for each offense.</p>\r\n\r\nOk, we’re not reading poetry, right? We’re also not reading a biblical text. In fact, this comes from section 4097y - bb of the Code of Virginia, and as you might expect, and older version. This is the Code of Virginia, 1942 to be exact. No, this is not current law.\r\n\r\n1. Why did you know this was law? (Was the text vague? What kind of sentences were used?)\r\n\r\n2. What was the motivation of this law? Why was it enacted?\r\n\r\n3. How did the people who enacted this law view the world? What does reading this bit of law reveal about the people who lived in that time?\r\nReadings are never neutral. They always have a writer who views the world in a particular way. They communicate information, but never everything there is to say on the subject. The above text, for instance, was grounded in a Supreme Court decision called Plessy vs. Ferguson, which declared segregation legal as long as it was “separate but equal.” Today, that same phrase communicates volumes about what was desired by that generation – a separation of peoples, even as people began to admit that inequality was not right.\r\nThere are parts of the Bible that are nothing but old legal codes too, and just like segregation laws, they may not apply today, but they do give an interesting glimpse into what both the people and their God desired.\r\n4.    Question: What percentage of the Bible do you think is legal in nature?\r\nThe answer may surprise you – even under the most generous definition of ‘legal texts’ is well under 10%, and of that percentage, only a small amount applied to the people. The primary ‘legal texts’ would be the second half of Exodus (starting with 1 chapter that is the 10 commandments, followed by a bunch of instructions about how the Temple should be built), the book of Leviticus, and then a repeat of Leviticus called Deuteronomy. Along with Genesis and Numbers, those books make up the most important Jewish scriptures – the Torah. Beyond the Torah, you could argue that parts of the New Testament in which Paul suggests certain behaviors as typifying a Christian life are “legal” in nature, and maybe even say that the book of Proverbs are “legal,” but I think you’re really stretching the definition at that point. The point is, relatively speaking, only very small parts of the Bible ‘regulate’ behavior. Contrary to what many unbelievers think, the Bible is NOT a set of rules on how to live your life.\r\nSo, if it’s not that, why do we read the old law at all? Well, there are a lot of reasons – the law makes us aware of our state before God (see Romans 5 &amp; 6, Galatians 3:24) and the law contains within it many “types of Christ,” meaning that things the law had the Hebrews do were reminiscent of how Jesus would live, die, and come again (see Hebrews). But beyond just understanding the law in order to make sense of much of what the New Testament was arguing against, it also gives us insight into what motivated its author, namely God. Let’s look at laws concerning slavery, and something called “the Jubilee” in Leviticus:\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">\r\nYou shall count seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty-nine years. Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land. 10 And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his clan. ... 23 “The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me. 24 And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.\r\n25 “If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold. 26 If a man has no one to\r\nredeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it, 27 let him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property. 28 But if he has not sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.\r\n29 “If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, he may redeem it within a year of its sale. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption. 30 If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city shall belong in perpetuity to the buyer, throughout his generations; it shall not be released in the jubilee. 31 But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them shall be classified with the fields of the land. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee. 32 As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem at any time the houses in the cities they possess. 33 And if one of the Levites exercises his right of redemption, then the house that was sold in a city they possess shall be released in the jubilee. For the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel. 34 But the fields of pastureland belonging to their cities may not be sold, for that is their possession forever.\r\n35 “If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you. 36 Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you. 37 You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit. 38 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.\r\n39 “If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave: 40 he shall be with you as a hired servant and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee. 41 Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return to the possession of his fathers. 42 For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves.</p>\r\n\r\nSo, let’s go back to our questions:\r\n5.    How does God appear to view slavery?\r\n\r\n6.    Is God commanding people to take slaves? Is he merely tolerating it or encouraging it? Does he\r\nview slavery as a good thing or a bad thing?\r\n\r\n7.    What in period in Israel’s history does God harken back to when he talks about slavery? Why?\r\nLet’s look at closely at the bolded phrase in Lev 25:10 – “proclaim liberty throughout the land.” Side note – the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia has Lev 25:10 inscribed on it. Anyways, that phrase appears a few more times elsewhere in the Bible. Rather than list them out for you, I want use to use a tool called a concordance to find out more. If you have a Strong’s Concrdance, you can use that, although I’ll admit, I prefer computer searches?\r\n\r\n8.    If you have internet access, go to http://biblos.com and search for the phrase ‘proclaim liberty.’ See if there is anything interesting there.\r\nLet’s look at tithing, because again, it’s another one of those “laws” that people think they know. By way of explanation, a tithe is a tenth of all you have.\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">22 “You shall tithe all the yield of your seed that comes from the field year by year. 23 And before the Lord your God, in the place that he will choose, to make his name dwell there, you shall eat the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and flock, that you may learn to fear the Lord your God always. 24 And if the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry the tithe, when the Lord your God blesses you, because the place is too far from you, which the Lord your God chooses, to set his name there, 25 then you shall turn it into money and bind up the money in your hand and go to the place that the Lord your God chooses 26 and spend the money for whatever you desire—oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink, whatever your appetite craves. And you shall eat there before the Lord your God and rejoice, you and your household. 27 And you shall not neglect the Levite who is within your towns, for he has no portion or inheritance with you</p>\r\n\r\n9.    Who is supposed to use the tithe? For what purpose?\r\n\r\n10. Is God really a cosmic killjoy? Is there any truth to the old definition of the Puritan, “one who lives in fear that someone, somewhere, might be happy?”\r\nFinally, you can’t really discuss Leviticus and Deuteronomy without talking about the categories of clean and unclean. There’s a lot who is and who is not clean, and it gets tied in with leprosy and stuff. (For a funny verse, if you have time, read Leviticus 13, starting somewhere in the middle and then stop on verse 40.) Clean and unclean are a lot like the segregation laws we started with.\r\nPlease Read Acts 10 to see what happened when Peter, a “clean” and observant Jew is first sent to proclaim the Gospel to the “unclean” Gentiles.\r\n11. So, what does God think about the categories of clean and unclean? We’ll discuss this on Sunday.

Is he merely tolerating it or encouraging it? Does he\nview slavery as a good thing or a bad thing?\n\n7.    What in period in Israel’s history does God harken back to when he talks about slavery? Why?\nLet’s look at closely at the bolded phrase in Lev 25:10 – “proclaim liberty throughout the land.” Side note – the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia has Lev 25:10 inscribed on it. Anyways, that phrase appears a few more times elsewhere in the Bible. Rather than list them out for you, I want use to use a tool called a concordance to find out more. If you have a Strong’s Concrdance, you can use that, although I’ll admit, I prefer computer searches?\n\n8.    If you have internet access, go to http://biblos.com and search for the phrase ‘proclaim liberty.’ See if there is anything interesting there.\nLet’s look at tithing, because again, it’s another one of those “laws” that people think they know. By way of explanation, a tithe is a tenth of all you have.\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">22 “You shall tithe all the yield of your seed that comes from the field year by year. 23 And before the Lord your God, in the place that he will choose, to make his name dwell there, you shall eat the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and flock, that you may learn to fear the Lord your God always. 24 And if the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry the tithe, when the Lord your God blesses you, because the place is too far from you, which the Lord your God chooses, to set his name there, 25 then you shall turn it into money and bind up the money in your hand and go to the place that the Lord your God chooses 26 and spend the money for whatever you desire—oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink, whatever your appetite craves. And you shall eat there before the Lord your God and rejoice, you and your household. 27 And you shall not neglect the Levite who is within your towns, for he has no portion or inheritance with you</p>\n\n9.    Who is supposed to use the tithe? For what purpose?\n\n10. Is God really a cosmic killjoy? Is there any truth to the old definition of the Puritan, “one who lives in fear that someone, somewhere, might be happy?”\nFinally, you can’t really discuss Leviticus and Deuteronomy without talking about the categories of clean and unclean. There’s a lot who is and who is not clean, and it gets tied in with leprosy and stuff. (For a funny verse, if you have time, read Leviticus 13, starting somewhere in the middle and then stop on verse 40.) Clean and unclean are a lot like the segregation laws we started with.\nPlease Read Acts 10 to see what happened when Peter, a “clean” and observant Jew is first sent to proclaim the Gospel to the “unclean” Gentiles.\n11.

We’re also not reading a biblical text. In fact, this comes from section 4097y - bb of the Code of Virginia, and as you might expect, and older version. This is the Code of Virginia, 1942 to be exact. No, this is not current law.\n\n1. Why did you know this was law? (Was the text vague? What kind of sentences were used?)\n\n2. What was the motivation of this law? Why was it enacted?\n\n3. How did the people who enacted this law view the world? What does reading this bit of law reveal about the people who lived in that time?\nReadings are never neutral. They always have a writer who views the world in a particular way. They communicate information, but never everything there is to say on the subject. The above text, for instance, was grounded in a Supreme Court decision called Plessy vs. Ferguson, which declared segregation legal as long as it was “separate but equal.” Today, that same phrase communicates volumes about what was desired by that generation – a separation of peoples, even as people began to admit that inequality was not right.\nThere are parts of the Bible that are nothing but old legal codes too, and just like segregation laws, they may not apply today, but they do give an interesting glimpse into what both the people and their God desired.\n4.    Question: What percentage of the Bible do you think is legal in nature?\nThe answer may surprise you – even under the most generous definition of ‘legal texts’ is well under 10%, and of that percentage, only a small amount applied to the people. The primary ‘legal texts’ would be the second half of Exodus (starting with 1 chapter that is the 10 commandments, followed by a bunch of instructions about how the Temple should be built), the book of Leviticus, and then a repeat of Leviticus called Deuteronomy. Along with Genesis and Numbers, those books make up the most important Jewish scriptures – the Torah. Beyond the Torah, you could argue that parts of the New Testament in which Paul suggests certain behaviors as typifying a Christian life are “legal” in nature, and maybe even say that the book of Proverbs are “legal,” but I think you’re really stretching the definition at that point. The point is, relatively speaking, only very small parts of the Bible ‘regulate’ behavior. Contrary to what many unbelievers think, the Bible is NOT a set of rules on how to live your life.\nSo, if it’s not that, why do we read the old law at all? Well, there are a lot of reasons – the law makes us aware of our state before God (see Romans 5 &amp; 6, Galatians 3:24) and the law contains within it many “types of Christ,” meaning that things the law had the Hebrews do were reminiscent of how Jesus would live, die, and come again (see Hebrews). But beyond just understanding the law in order to make sense of much of what the New Testament was arguing against, it also gives us insight into what motivated its author, namely God. Let’s look at laws concerning slavery, and something called “the Jubilee” in Leviticus:\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You shall count seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty-nine years. Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land. 10 And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his clan. ... 23 “The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me. 24 And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.\n25 “If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold. 26 If a man has no one to\nredeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it, 27 let him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property. 28 But if he has not sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property.\n29 “If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, he may redeem it within a year of its sale. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption. 30 If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city shall belong in perpetuity to the buyer, throughout his generations; it shall not be released in the jubilee. 31 But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them shall be classified with the fields of the land. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee. 32 As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem at any time the houses in the cities they possess. 33 And if one of the Levites exercises his right of redemption, then the house that was sold in a city they possess shall be released in the jubilee. For the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel. 34 But the fields of pastureland belonging to their cities may not be sold, for that is their possession forever.\n35 “If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you. 36 Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you. 37 You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit. 38 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.\n39 “If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave: 40 he shall be with you as a hired servant and as a sojourner.

(291, 1, '2010-10-30 16:03:14', '2010-10-30 21:03:14', 'Parables\r\n\r\nOnce was I asked to come up with a definition of the word “art,” and my answer was this: ‘Art is the attempt to promote a point of view under the cover of aesthetics.’ It’s been years since I came up with that and I still think I’m on the right track. Every book, every song, every movie, every piece of art has a point – and the most skillful art is that which makes its point with such subtlety that many don’t even realize it.\r\n\r\nJonathan Swift once wrote a scathing story called ‘<em>A Modest Proposal</em>.’ The story took the form of an editorial advocating the use of Irish children as food – an obviously outlandish proposal – but one which had the effect of highlighting the gross indifference that many Brits had towards the Irish. <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, a “story of the South,” was a work of fiction that highlighted the abuses of slavery.  Even <em>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe</em> – ostensibly “just a children’s story,” is the first narrative of the Cross that many ever see.\r\n\r\nOr, think about all the movies you’ve seen. Star Wars’ point was that the underdog will defeat the Death Star and that “the force” balances all.  Every Romantic comedy ever made ends up trying to say that “true love” is never predictable, must be spontaneous and is the single most important thing a guy and a girl can get. And the point of Avatar, of course, is that no matter how derivative the story line, people will do anything to see cool effects.\r\n\r\nThe point is that if you’ve ever watched TV, read a book, listened to a song, or viewed anything called “art,” you have all the skills you need to understand parables. If you can strip away the symbols and get to the “point” the creator is trying to make, you know how to read a parable.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the problem most people have isn’t that they can’t “get” the stories of Jesus – but rather they think everything is a parable and that everything in a parable has to have some even “deeper” level of meaning.  Now, don’t misunderstand me, please – parables are “deep” in that they are profound. But, what they aren’t is so “deep” that you can’t get the point or the symbolism.\r\n\r\nA Warning on what *NOT* to do:\r\n\r\nBefore we actually look at a parable, I want to give you one example of how <em>not </em>to read a parable. In their book <em>How to Read the Bible For All Its Worth</em>, Gordon Fee  &amp; Douglas Stuart offer the following illustration of how the <em>parable</em> of the Good Samaritan was turned into an <em>allegory</em>, and why that also is a mistake.\r\n\r\n“Thus as great and brilliant a scholar as Augustine offers the following interpretation of the parable of the Good Samaritan:\r\n\r\n<em>A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho = Adam</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Jerusalem = the heavenly city of peace from which Adam fell</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Jericho = the moon, and thereby signifies Adam’s mortality</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Thieves = the devil and his angels</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Stripped him = namely of his immortality</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Beat him = by persuading him to sin</em>\r\n\r\n<em>And left him half-dead = as a man he lives, but he died spiritually, therefore he is half-dead</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The priest and the Levite = the priesthood and ministry of the Old Testament</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The Samaritan = is said to mean ‘Guardian,’ and therefore means Christ himself</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Bound his wounds = means binding therestraint of sin</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Oil = comfort of Good hope</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Wine = exhortation to work with a fervent spirit</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Beast = the flesh of Christ’s incarnation</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Inn = the church</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The morrow = after the Resurrection</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Two-pence = promise of this life and the life to come</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Innkeeper = Paul</em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\nAs novel and interesting as all of this might be, one can be sure this is not what Jesus intended. After all, the context clearly calls for an understanding of human relationships (“Who is my neighbor?”), not divine to human; and there is no reason to think that Jesus would predict the church and Paul in this obtuse fashion! <a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>\r\n\r\nIn other words – read the parables, don’t read into them!  Basically, I would offer two rules of thumb:\r\n\r\n1.     If other people don’t see the same symbolism you do, be wary of it\r\n\r\n2.     Look at the context to see if this is in line with other things being taught.\r\n\r\nSo, with a firm grounding in what we shouldn’t do, let’s do what we should, and read:\r\n\r\n<em>Matthew 13:24 – 30 Parable of the Wheat and Weeds</em>\r\n\r\n<sup>24 </sup>Here is another story Jesus told: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field. <sup>25 </sup>But that night as the workers slept, his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat, then slipped away. <sup>26 </sup>When the crop began to grow and produce grain, the weeds also grew.\r\n\r\n<sup>27 </sup>“The farmer’s workers went to him and said, ‘Sir, the field where you planted that good seed is full of weeds! Where did they come from?’\r\n\r\n<sup>28 </sup>“ ‘An enemy has done this!’ the farmer exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“ ‘Should we pull out the weeds?’ they asked.\r\n\r\n<sup>29 </sup>“ ‘No,’ he replied, ‘you’ll uproot the wheat if you do. <sup>30 </sup>Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds, tie them into bundles, and burn them, and to put the wheat in the barn.’ ”\r\n\r\n1.     What is the problem in the farmer’s field?\r\n\r\n2.     Why doesn’t the farmer want the workers to pull the weeds?<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>\r\n\r\n3.     What is the ultimate fate of the weeds?\r\n\r\n4.     Does God actually <em>need</em> us to ‘weed his garden,’ so to speak?\r\n\r\n5.     What is he more concern with us doing?\r\n\r\nSo, I’ll admit – this is one of my favorite parables to preach. I like it because you can put names to the various principles found inside:\r\n\r\n-       Tolerance:            We aren’t called to uproot every evil we see in the world\r\n\r\n-       Judgment:            We are called not to be weeds\r\n\r\n-       Patience:            We need to wait to see the outcomes\r\n\r\nWhy can I feel so confident in this interpretation? Well, for one thing, this is not an isolated principle – I can find other things, even in the same book, that echo similar themes.\r\n\r\n6.     Look up Matt 7:15. What does Jesus say about people of whom it is unclear whether they are good or bad? What is the best policy for dealing with those people? Is that similar to this parable?\r\n\r\n7.     Look at Matt 5.45b (For he makes…). Can you tell whether someone is good or bad based on how “successful” they are or whether or not they appear to “blessed” by God? Why or why not?\r\n\r\nIndeed, this problem comes up a lot. I could point to the whole book of Job, and we could spend a whole lot of time asking, “Why do the wicked propser?” (How many Psalms ask this question?) I do want to point out this, however:\r\n\r\n8.     Look up Ecclesiastes 8:10 – 13, especially looking at v11. What happens when justice is delayed? (i.e. when bad people get away with things.)  Could this explain why bad stuff happens?\r\n\r\nSo, at the risk of preaching J I have to say, this complexity is why I love Scripture. I’m sure you’ve all seen the really bad cartoons where the bad guy has an evil mustache and is going TO RULE THE WORLD!™ because he is, well, bad.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> When you’re six, these cartoons are great. They’re easy to follow, they’re exciting, and they tell a story.  But, there’s a problem with it. How many bad people do you know that actually think they’re doing bad things?  Not many, right?  Everybody thinks they are doing the right thing – or if they think they’re doing the wrong thing, they usually at least feel bad about it.\r\n\r\n9.     So, if people are capable of a great deal of self-justification, how do we ensure that we really are doing what God wants?\r\n\r\nAnyways, back to the parable.  You can never go wrong by reading more, especially right near what you’ve just been reading.  If you were to pick up in Matt 13:36, for instance, you’d see this:\r\n\r\n<em>Parable of the Wheat and Weeds Explained</em>\r\n\r\n<sup>36 </sup>Then, leaving the crowds outside, Jesus went into the house. His disciples said, “Please explain to us the story of the weeds in the field.”\r\n\r\n<sup>37 </sup>Jesus replied, “The Son of Man<sup>*</sup> is the farmer who plants the good seed. <sup>38 </sup>The field is the world, and the good seed represents the people of the Kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one. <sup>39 </sup>The enemy who planted the weeds among the wheat is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world,<sup>*</sup> and the harvesters are the angels.\r\n\r\n<sup>40 </sup>“Just as the weeds are sorted out and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the world. <sup>41 </sup>The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his Kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. <sup>42 </sup>And the angels will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup>43 </sup>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father’s Kingdom. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!<a href="#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>\r\n\r\n10.  Of the themes I pointed out earlier (tolerance, judgment, and patience) which one is Jesus trying to emphasize here?\r\n\r\n11.  Going back to Matt 13:29, why did the farmer spare the weeds again?\r\n\r\n12.  Could this be an indication of God’s love for both believers AND unbelievers?\r\n\r\nAlways, always, always be on the lookout for when Jesus explains a parable!\r\n\r\nHere’s another stylistic thing to look for.  Did you notice that I skipped some verses? Both Matthew and Mark love what is called ‘inclusio.’ I like to call it “the sandwich.”  Verses 24 – 30 are, of course, the parable itself, and 37 – 43 is the explanation. If you call this parable “A”, then the text has A – B – A’.  (B being ‘some other stuff.’, and A’ being a return to the subject of A in a slightly different fashion.)\r\n\r\nThere’s lots of patterns like this. Right before Jesus throws over the money-changer’s tables, Jesus cursed a fig tree for not producing fruit. (Call that A) Then, Jesus gets ticked (Call it B) Finally, after Jesus leaves the Temple, it says that they looked at the fig tree that Jesus had cursed, and what do you, that fig tree has completely withered in just a few hours. (A’)  Now, you could get a little bit artsy here and realize that the A stuff is a comment on the B stuff – the A stuff is like pieces of bread around the B-stuff filling.  If you were to imagine that the people in the Temple should have been producing “great fruit” for the Kingdom, and it turns out that they weren’t, can you see a parallel in the A story?\r\n\r\nWell, with that in mind, let’s look at the “filling” of Matt 13.\r\n\r\n<em>Parable of the Mustard Seed</em>\r\n\r\n<sup>31 </sup>Here is another illustration Jesus used: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed planted in a field. <sup>32 </sup>It is the smallest of all seeds, but it becomes the largest of garden plants; it grows into a tree, and birds come and make nests in its branches.”\r\n\r\n<em>Parable of the Yeast</em>\r\n\r\n<sup>33 </sup>Jesus also used this illustration: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast a woman used in making bread. Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour, it permeated every part of the dough.”\r\n\r\nOkay, so these parables (or perhaps more properly metaphors) do NOT have explanations, and frankly are probably a bit more ‘mysterious.’  But, remember that we have contextual clues.\r\n\r\n13.  In both cases, we have a metaphor for growing, right? (By the way – notice the parable that starts the chapter off – the parable of the soils).  Why do you think Jesus chose to give so many parables about growing things?\r\n\r\n14.  Now, consider that Jesus could have appeared at any time in history. How would these parables have been different if he had lived in say, Britain at the height of the Industrial Revolution, or even in todays’ “Information Age.”  Do you think that he might have had a reason in specifically choosing a primarily agricultural society?\r\n\r\n15.  How does the metaphor of “growing” differ from the metaphor of “building,” especially when it comes to living one’s life or organizing a church?\r\n\r\n16.  What are the growing things explicitly compared to?\r\n\r\n17.  Is yeast typically considered a good thing or a bad thing in Jewish circles? (Hint: Right before Passover, Jewish houses need to be cleaned of all the yeast)\r\n\r\n18.  Are birds typically seen as something positive or negative?

(293, 1, '2010-10-30 16:03:14', '2010-10-30 21:03:14', 'Parables\r\n\r\nOnce was I asked to come up with a definition of the word “art,” and my answer was this: ‘Art is the attempt to promote a point of view under the cover of aesthetics.’ It’s been years since I came up with that and I still think I’m on the right track. Every book, every song, every movie, every piece of art has a point – and the most skillful art is that which makes its point with such subtlety that many don’t even realize it.\r\n\r\nJonathan Swift once wrote a scathing story called ‘<em>A Modest Proposal</em>.’ The story took the form of an editorial advocating the use of Irish children as food – an obviously outlandish proposal – but one which had the effect of highlighting the gross indifference that many Brits had towards the Irish. <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, a “story of the South,” was a work of fiction that highlighted the abuses of slavery.  Even <em>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe</em> – ostensibly “just a children’s story,” is the first narrative of the Cross that many ever see.\r\n\r\nOr, think about all the movies you’ve seen. Star Wars’ point was that the underdog will defeat the Death Star and that “the force” balances all.  Every Romantic comedy ever made ends up trying to say that “true love” is never predictable, must be spontaneous and is the single most important thing a guy and a girl can get. And the point of Avatar, of course, is that no matter how derivative the story line, people will do anything to see cool effects.\r\n\r\nThe point is that if you’ve ever watched TV, read a book, listened to a song, or viewed anything called “art,” you have all the skills you need to understand parables. If you can strip away the symbols and get to the “point” the creator is trying to make, you know how to read a parable.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the problem most people have isn’t that they can’t “get” the stories of Jesus – but rather they think everything is a parable and that everything in a parable has to have some even “deeper” level of meaning.  Now, don’t misunderstand me, please – parables are “deep” in that they are profound. But, what they aren’t is so “deep” that you can’t get the point or the symbolism.\r\n\r\nA Warning on what *NOT* to do:\r\n\r\nBefore we actually look at a parable, I want to give you one example of how <em>not </em>to read a parable. In their book <em>How to Read the Bible For All Its Worth</em>, Gordon Fee  &amp; Douglas Stuart offer the following illustration of how the <em>parable</em> of the Good Samaritan was turned into an <em>allegory</em>, and why that also is a mistake.\r\n\r\n“Thus as great and brilliant a scholar as Augustine offers the following interpretation of the parable of the Good Samaritan:\r\n\r\n<em>A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho = Adam</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Jerusalem = the heavenly city of peace from which Adam fell</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Jericho = the moon, and thereby signifies Adam’s mortality</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Thieves = the devil and his angels</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Stripped him = namely of his immortality</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Beat him = by persuading him to sin</em>\r\n\r\n<em>And left him half-dead = as a man he lives, but he died spiritually, therefore he is half-dead</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The priest and the Levite = the priesthood and ministry of the Old Testament</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The Samaritan = is said to mean ‘Guardian,’ and therefore means Christ himself</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Bound his wounds = means binding therestraint of sin</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Oil = comfort of Good hope</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Wine = exhortation to work with a fervent spirit</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Beast = the flesh of Christ’s incarnation</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Inn = the church</em>\r\n\r\n<em>The morrow = after the Resurrection</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Two-pence = promise of this life and the life to come</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Innkeeper = Paul</em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\nAs novel and interesting as all of this might be, one can be sure this is not what Jesus intended. After all, the context clearly calls for an understanding of human relationships (“Who is my neighbor?”), not divine to human; and there is no reason to think that Jesus would predict the church and Paul in this obtuse fashion! <a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>\r\n\r\nIn other words – read the parables, don’t read into them!  Basically, I would offer two rules of thumb:\r\n\r\n1.     If other people don’t see the same symbolism you do, be wary of it\r\n\r\n2.     Look at the context to see if this is in line with other things being taught.\r\n\r\nSo, with a firm grounding in what we shouldn’t do, let’s do what we should, and read:\r\n\r\n<em>Matthew 13:24 – 30 Parable of the Wheat and Weeds</em>\r\n\r\n<sup>24 </sup>Here is another story Jesus told: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field. <sup>25 </sup>But that night as the workers slept, his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat, then slipped away. <sup>26 </sup>When the crop began to grow and produce grain, the weeds also grew.\r\n\r\n<sup>27 </sup>“The farmer’s workers went to him and said, ‘Sir, the field where you planted that good seed is full of weeds! Where did they come from?’\r\n\r\n<sup>28 </sup>“ ‘An enemy has done this!’ the farmer exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“ ‘Should we pull out the weeds?’ they asked.\r\n\r\n<sup>29 </sup>“ ‘No,’ he replied, ‘you’ll uproot the wheat if you do. <sup>30 </sup>Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds, tie them into bundles, and burn them, and to put the wheat in the barn.’ ”\r\n\r\n1.     What is the problem in the farmer’s field?\r\n\r\n2.     Why doesn’t the farmer want the workers to pull the weeds?<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>\r\n\r\n3.     What is the ultimate fate of the weeds?\r\n\r\n4.     Does God actually <em>need</em> us to ‘weed his garden,’ so to speak?\r\n\r\n5.     What is he more concern with us doing?\r\n\r\nSo, I’ll admit – this is one of my favorite parables to preach. I like it because you can put names to the various principles found inside:\r\n\r\n-       Tolerance:            We aren’t called to uproot every evil we see in the world\r\n\r\n-       Judgment:            We are called not to be weeds\r\n\r\n-       Patience:            We need to wait to see the outcomes\r\n\r\nWhy can I feel so confident in this interpretation? Well, for one thing, this is not an isolated principle – I can find other things, even in the same book, that echo similar themes.\r\n\r\n6.     Look up Matt 7:15. What does Jesus say about people of whom it is unclear whether they are good or bad? What is the best policy for dealing with those people? Is that similar to this parable?\r\n\r\n7.     Look at Matt 5.45b (For he makes…). Can you tell whether someone is good or bad based on how “successful” they are or whether or not they appear to “blessed” by God? Why or why not?\r\n\r\nIndeed, this problem comes up a lot. I could point to the whole book of Job, and we could spend a whole lot of time asking, “Why do the wicked propser?” (How many Psalms ask this question?) I do want to point out this, however:\r\n\r\n8.     Look up Ecclesiastes 8:10 – 13, especially looking at v11. What happens when justice is delayed? (i.e. when bad people get away with things.)  Could this explain why bad stuff happens?\r\n\r\nSo, at the risk of preaching J I have to say, this complexity is why I love Scripture. I’m sure you’ve all seen the really bad cartoons where the bad guy has an evil mustache and is going TO RULE THE WORLD!™ because he is, well, bad.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> When you’re six, these cartoons are great. They’re easy to follow, they’re exciting, and they tell a story.  But, there’s a problem with it. How many bad people do you know that actually think they’re doing bad things?  Not many, right?  Everybody thinks they are doing the right thing – or if they think they’re doing the wrong thing, they usually at least feel bad about it.\r\n\r\n9.     So, if people are capable of a great deal of self-justification, how do we ensure that we really are doing what God wants?\r\n\r\nAnyways, back to the parable.  You can never go wrong by reading more, especially right near what you’ve just been reading.  If you were to pick up in Matt 13:36, for instance, you’d see this:\r\n\r\n<em>Parable of the Wheat and Weeds Explained</em>\r\n\r\n<sup>36 </sup>Then, leaving the crowds outside, Jesus went into the house. His disciples said, “Please explain to us the story of the weeds in the field.”\r\n\r\n<sup>37 </sup>Jesus replied, “The Son of Man<sup>*</sup> is the farmer who plants the good seed. <sup>38 </sup>The field is the world, and the good seed represents the people of the Kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one. <sup>39 </sup>The enemy who planted the weeds among the wheat is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world,<sup>*</sup> and the harvesters are the angels.\r\n\r\n<sup>40 </sup>“Just as the weeds are sorted out and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the world. <sup>41 </sup>The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his Kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. <sup>42 </sup>And the angels will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup>43 </sup>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father’s Kingdom. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!<a href="#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>\r\n\r\n10.  Of the themes I pointed out earlier (tolerance, judgment, and patience) which one is Jesus trying to emphasize here?\r\n\r\n11.  Going back to Matt 13:29, why did the farmer spare the weeds again?\r\n\r\n12.  Could this be an indication of God’s love for both believers AND unbelievers?\r\n\r\nAlways, always, always be on the lookout for when Jesus explains a parable!\r\n\r\nHere’s another stylistic thing to look for.  Did you notice that I skipped some verses? Both Matthew and Mark love what is called ‘inclusio.’ I like to call it “the sandwich.”  Verses 24 – 30 are, of course, the parable itself, and 37 – 43 is the explanation. If you call this parable “A”, then the text has A – B – A’.  (B being ‘some other stuff.’, and A’ being a return to the subject of A in a slightly different fashion.)\r\n\r\nThere’s lots of patterns like this. Right before Jesus throws over the money-changer’s tables, Jesus cursed a fig tree for not producing fruit. (Call that A) Then, Jesus gets ticked (Call it B) Finally, after Jesus leaves the Temple, it says that they looked at the fig tree that Jesus had cursed, and what do you, that fig tree has completely withered in just a few hours. (A’)  Now, you could get a little bit artsy here and realize that the A stuff is a comment on the B stuff – the A stuff is like pieces of bread around the B-stuff filling.  If you were to imagine that the people in the Temple should have been producing “great fruit” for the Kingdom, and it turns out that they weren’t, can you see a parallel in the A story?\r\n\r\nWell, with that in mind, let’s look at the “filling” of Matt 13.\r\n\r\n<em>Parable of the Mustard Seed</em>\r\n\r\n<sup>31 </sup>Here is another illustration Jesus used: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed planted in a field. <sup>32 </sup>It is the smallest of all seeds, but it becomes the largest of garden plants; it grows into a tree, and birds come and make nests in its branches.”\r\n\r\n<em>Parable of the Yeast</em>\r\n\r\n<sup>33 </sup>Jesus also used this illustration: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast a woman used in making bread. Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour, it permeated every part of the dough.”\r\n\r\nOkay, so these parables (or perhaps more properly metaphors) do NOT have explanations, and frankly are probably a bit more ‘mysterious.’  But, remember that we have contextual clues.\r\n\r\n13.  In both cases, we have a metaphor for growing, right? (By the way – notice the parable that starts the chapter off – the parable of the soils).  Why do you think Jesus chose to give so many parables about growing things?\r\n\r\n14.  Now, consider that Jesus could have appeared at any time in history. How would these parables have been different if he had lived in say, Britain at the height of the Industrial Revolution, or even in todays’ “Information Age.”  Do you think that he might have had a reason in specifically choosing a primarily agricultural society?\r\n\r\n15.  How does the metaphor of “growing” differ from the metaphor of “building,” especially when it comes to living one’s life or organizing a church?\r\n\r\n16.  What are the growing things explicitly compared to?\r\n\r\n17.  Is yeast typically considered a good thing or a bad thing in Jewish circles? (Hint: Right before Passover, Jewish houses need to be cleaned of all the yeast)\r\n\r\n18.  Are birds typically seen as something positive or negative? (Hint: Think Hitchcock’s <em>The Birds</em> instead\r\n\r\nSo, with all this growth that is simply expected and assumed (and therein lies another lesson!), what is the concern?  Think back to 2 John, 3 John, and many of the epistles.  Look at Jude – almost entirely a warning about ‘false teachers.’ Think about other parables, like the parable of the foolish bridesmaids or the parable of the talents.  Can you see a common themes emerging?\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n19.  When we are growing, what is the best way to be on our guard?\r\n\r\nHave fun answering that one.  See you on Sunday, the 14<sup>th</sup>.\r\n\r\n<hr size="1" /><a href="#_ftnref">[1]</a> Fee &amp; Stuart, How to Read the Bible for All its Worth, p.136.  It’s a great book!\r\n\r\n<a href="#_ftnref">[2]</a> Just as an FYI, the weed here is probably <em>darnel</em> – a poisonous weed that is indistinguishable from wheat until both are fullgrown.\r\n\r\n<a href="#_ftnref">[3]</a> Pinky, are you thinking what I’m thinking?\r\n\r\n<a href="#_ftnref"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Tyndale House Publishers.

(294, 1, '2010-10-30 16:05:43', '2010-10-30 21:05:43', 'Context\r\n\r\nThe biggest mistake most people make when reading the Bible is to think too small. Yes, the Bible is a collection of books, and many of the books can in turn be studied as a collection of stories, songs, sayings, or whatever – but what is easy to miss sight of is the fact that the Bible is in fact the sum of its parts.\r\n\r\nAs a cheap aside, I wrote the following “essay” a few years back in order to get some free books for my Bible software, but I think it''s still worth reading: (Nice formatting at http://www.logos.com/nationalbibleweek/biblestudy/54)\r\n\r\nBible Study with the Telescope and the Microscope\r\n\r\nWhen we sit down to do serious Bible Study, we have all sorts of tools available to aid us in making discoveries. But generally these Bible Study tools fall into two categories – Microscopes and telescopes. As any good scientist can tell you, these tools each have their uses, and to learn the most you need to know to use them both.\r\n\r\nThe microscope Bible Study tools are perhaps the more common ones.  TDNT, HALOT, BDAG – all kinds of tools exist that hone in on a single word and give great depth to each word. Like a microscope, these tools are at their best when they focus in on a single detail which has riches to unfold. Like a doctor studying a cell, the serious student of the Bible will be amazed at the universe hidden in such simple words as <em>telos</em>, <em>charis</em>, or <em>agape</em>.\r\n\r\nBut these Bible Study microscopes were never meant to be ends to themselves. After all, a cell unrelated to the rest of the organism is a quick candidate for death!  This is why good Bible Study should also use the telescope, too.  Telescopes, of course, help the astronomer to see very large things in closer detail. Commentaries, Concordances, sentence diagrams and even Systematic Theologies play a role in helping the student of the Bible to see how each part relates to the whole.\r\n\r\nEven a tool as humble as the outline can sometimes reveal insights unseen to the unaided eye. You probably know the story of Martha slaving away in the kitchen while Jesus sits at Mary’s feet. But do you know its context?  Luke 11 starts out Jesus famously summarizing the law as loving God and loving your neighbor.  Jesus then tells the story of the Good Samaritan to illustrate who our neighbor is.  But then Luke inserts the story of Mary and Martha.  Why?  Could it be that Luke realized the parallel of loving your neighbor, and then loving God?  How after all, do we love God, except by sitting at his feet and listening to what he says? (Interestingly enough, do you know what follows? It''s Luke''s version of the Lord''s Prayer.  If your God wants a relationship, how else but prayer?)\r\n\r\nSometimes, something as simple as asking, "What would I title this chapter?" yields insights into how each cell does its thing.\r\n\r\nSuch a Bible Study ‘aha’ becomes all the more precious when, as with a telescope, you see the whole picture in context – one theme building on another.  Don’t miss out in Bible Study; Use your microscope, but don’t forget the telescope, too!\r\n\r\nWhen one reads Scripture, one needs to always remember that every verse fits somewhere in context. It has been said that without context any verse can simply be used as pre-text.  On my home page, I have one of those “Verse a Day” gadgets that simply shows a single Bible verse.  One day, the verse was Matthew 4:9 "All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me."  I am sure that day some people saw that verse and thought, “See – if I worship God he will in face give me everything I desire!”  The “Name It &amp; Claim It” people were probably pretty happy that day.  But here''s a question for you? What is the context of that verse.  Go ahead – I''ll make it a question:\r\n\r\n1.              Who is the “he” [he said] in this Scripture and to whom is he talking?  What is the context of Matthew 4?\r\n\r\nAs good students of the Bible it is important that we are always aware of context. Ideally, whenever we read any verse (and ESPECIALLY when we memorize one!), we would know:\r\n\r\n–               something about the paragraph in which the verse appears\r\n\r\n–               something about the chapter in which the paragraph sits\r\n\r\n–               something about the book in which the chapter sits\r\n\r\n–               how that book fits in historically and within the whole redemption story.\r\n\r\nI''ll be honest, that takes work. Its hard to keep all of that in mind, and still plumb the depths of what God is trying to say.  So, how do I do it?  I''ll read a passage several times in order to really get to the meaning.\r\n\r\nRead #1: What is God trying to say in this particular passage?\r\n\r\nRead #2: What are some of the most important words? What do they mean?\r\n\r\nRead #3: What is the chapter as a whole about?\r\n\r\nThis month, let''s try doing Reads 1 &amp; 3 on Luke 16.  Let me give you the whole text. First, we''ll examine some of the parts, then we''ll go back and try to put the whole thing together.  I''ll divide it up into three sections.  Read each part first, then we''ll try to assemble the whole\r\n\r\n<em>Parable of the Shrewd Manager</em>\r\n\r\n16 Jesus told this story to his disciples: “There was a certain rich man who had a manager handling his affairs. One day a report came that the manager was wasting his employer’s money. <sup>2 </sup>So the employer called him in and said, ‘What’s this I hear about you? Get your report in order, because you are going to be fired.’\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>“The manager thought to himself, ‘Now what? My boss has fired me. I don’t have the strength to dig ditches, and I’m too proud to beg. <sup>4 </sup>Ah, I know how to ensure that I’ll have plenty of friends who will give me a home when I am fired.’\r\n\r\n<sup>5 </sup>“So he invited each person who owed money to his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first one, ‘How much do you owe him?’ <sup>6 </sup>The man replied, ‘I owe him 800 gallons of olive oil.’ So the manager told him, ‘Take the bill and quickly change it to 400 gallons.<sup>*</sup>’\r\n\r\n<sup>7 </sup>“ ‘And how much do you owe my employer?’ he asked the next man. ‘I owe him 1,000 bushels of wheat,’ was the reply. ‘Here,’ the manager said, ‘take the bill and change it to 800 bushels.<sup>*</sup>’\r\n\r\n<sup>8 </sup>“The rich man had to admire the dishonest rascal for being so shrewd. And it is true that the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with the world around them than are the children of the light. <sup>9 </sup>Here’s the lesson: Use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends. Then, when your earthly possessions are gone, they will welcome you to an eternal home.\r\n\r\n2.              What type of literature is this?\r\n\r\n3.              What is the essential conflict of this story?\r\n\r\n4.              Does the “Shrewd Manager” act in a “Christian” manner? In other words, is he sinning? If so, how?\r\n\r\n5.              Is Jesus commending the sin?\r\n\r\n6.              What was Jesus happy about in this man’s actions?\r\n\r\n7.              What is the “lesson” that this parable teaches?\r\n\r\n<sup>10 </sup>“If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won’t be honest with greater responsibilities. <sup>11 </sup>And if you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with the true riches of heaven? <sup>12 </sup>And if you are not faithful with other people’s things, why should you be trusted with things of your own?\r\n\r\n<sup>13 </sup>“No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”\r\n\r\n<sup>14 </sup>The Pharisees, who dearly loved their money, heard all this and scoffed at him. <sup>15 </sup>Then he said to them, “You like to appear righteous in public, but God knows your hearts. What this world honors is detestable in the sight of God.\r\n\r\n<sup>16 </sup>“Until John the Baptist, the law of Moses and the messages of the prophets were your guides. But now the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is eager to get in. <sup>17 </sup>But that doesn’t mean that the law has lost its force. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest point of God’s law to be overturned.\r\n\r\n<sup>18 </sup>“For example, a man who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery. And anyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.”\r\n\r\n8.              What type of literature is this?\r\n\r\n9.              In verses 10-12, what does Jesus say about the role of money in this world?  Do the words “training wheels” make any sense in this regard?\r\n\r\n10.           In verse 13-15, what is the danger of money? Look up 1 Timothy 6:10 for a god parallel.\r\n\r\n11.           Is the Pharisee’s reaction in verse 14 understandable? Why would they scoff? What would that sound like in today’s words? Have I ever done that? [Ok, I’m stopping there!]\r\n\r\n12.           In verse 15, what does the world value? What does God, in contrast, value? Why are these in conflict?\r\n\r\nNow,  before we look at 16 – 18, I’ll also admit I had to scratch my head a bit and ask myself how this fits into this chapter. When I first read this bit, I read it in the ESV and the NIV before the NLT (which is what I tend to use here because of its readability.)  The point I’m wanting to make is this – reading in different translations will sometimes help you “get” a section, especially if a passage has you wondering.  If you are wondering about a particular passage, that’s always a good sign you should stop and investigate!\r\n\r\n13.           In verse 16, what is Jesus talking about when he uses the words “the law” and “the prophets”?\r\n\r\n14.           The end of verse 16 seems to imply that what Jesus is teaching [the Good News of the Kingdom of God] is somehow more popular than the “law and the prophets.”  Does that mean the Old Testament is irrelevant?\r\n\r\n15.           How does the example of adultery explain the permanence of the law?\r\n\r\nNow, just a little bit of hint and reflection here.  Is money a long-term thing? How about people? How about Scripture? Yes, I’m leading you here, but I want to again come back to what I was saying about “things that don’t fit should make you go back and think.”  I “knew” what the first parable was about and what the last story we’re going to read was about, until I had to ask myself, how does verse 18 fit?  When I asked myself that question, I realized I didn’t “know” as much as I thought.\r\n\r\nAnyways, the last bit:\r\n\r\n<strong>The Rich Man and Lazarus</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><sup>19</sup></strong> “There was a rich man who was clothed in <em><sup>e</sup></em>purple and fine linen and <em><sup>f</sup></em>who feasted sumptuously every day. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong> And at his gate <em><sup>g</sup></em>was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong> who desired to be fed with <em><sup>h</sup></em>what fell from the rich man’s table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong> The poor man died and was carried by <em><sup>i</sup></em>the angels <em><sup>j</sup></em>to Abraham’s side.<em><sup>6</sup></em> The rich man also died and was buried, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong> and in <em><sup>k</sup></em>Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and <em><sup>l</sup></em>saw Abraham far off and Lazarus <em><sup>j</sup></em>at his side. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong> And he called out, <em><sup>m</sup></em>‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and <em><sup>n</sup></em>cool my tongue, for <em><sup>o</sup></em>I am in anguish in this flame.’ <strong><sup>25</sup></strong> But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that <em><sup>p</sup></em>you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong> And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’ <strong><sup>27</sup></strong> And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father’s house— <strong><sup>28</sup></strong> for I have five brothers<em><sup>7</sup></em>—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ <strong><sup>29</sup></strong> But Abraham said, ‘They have <em><sup>q</sup></em>Moses and the Prophets; <em><sup>r</sup></em>let them hear them.’ <strong><sup>30</sup></strong> And he said, ‘No, <em><sup>s</sup></em>father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ <strong><sup>31</sup></strong> He said to him, ‘If they do not hear <em><sup>q</sup></em>Moses and the Prophets, <em><sup>t</sup></em>neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’ ” <a href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>\r\n\r\n16.           What type of literature is this?\r\n\r\nDon’t skip over that question, because frankly, Christians have been divided over that question for a long time. It’s easy to think this is a parable, because it has a pretty strong point and the story can easily be thought of as a set of fantastic stereotypes.  Because it talks about heaven and hell, which are hard for us to grasp, it’s easier for some people to “dismiss” this as parable. On the other hand, unlike every other parable, Jesus actually names the characters, and unlike every other parable it does NOT liken a situation to something that the hearers would identify with.\r\n\r\n17.           Does thinking of this as a parable or reality change your perception in any way?\r\n\r\n18.           How did the rich man live? How did Lazarus live?\r\n\r\n19.           Where did the rich man go in death? Where did Lazarus go in death?\r\n\r\n20.           Are there other people with Lazarus? How about the rich man?\r\n\r\n21.           Is it possible for those in heaven to reach those in Hell?\r\n\r\n22.           How can there be a place where God cannot go?  [Talk to the Gateway kids about <em>The Great Divorce!!!</em>]\r\n\r\n23.           So, contrary to the popular notion that “Hell is a great place to party,” how does Lazarus speak of his torment? What is his plea?\r\n\r\n24.           What is Abraham’s response? Do we in fact have the things he says they already have?\r\n\r\n25.           In verse 30, is that completely true?\r\n\r\n26.           What is Jesus implying about how the rich man should have acted?\r\n\r\n27.           What is Jesus implying about the Scriptures?\r\n\r\nOkay, now that we have read all this, it’s back to context.  I should say that Luke 15 is the Parable of the Prodigal Son (or the Parable of the Loving Father or the Parable of the Older Brother depending on how you want to call it.)  Luke 17 is getting into Jesus’ final teachings as he heads to the Cross.  The question we want to get at is, what is Luke 16 teaching us?\r\n\r\n28.           What are some of the common themes?\r\n\r\n29.           So, you have NO MORE THAN 10 words.  What is the point of Luke 16?\r\n\r\nHere’s mine, but it isn’t the only one:\r\n\r\nLove Lasts; Wealth doesn’t.

Yes, the Bible is a collection of books, and many of the books can in turn be studied as a collection of stories, songs, sayings, or whatever – but what is easy to miss sight of is the fact that the Bible is in fact the sum of its parts.\n\nAs a cheap aside, I wrote the following “essay” a few years back in order to get some free books for my Bible software, but I think it''s still worth reading: (Nice formatting at http://www.logos.com/nationalbibleweek/biblestudy/54)\n\nBible Study with the Telescope and the Microscope\n\nWhen we sit down to do serious Bible Study, we have all sorts of tools available to aid us in making discoveries. But generally these Bible Study tools fall into two categories – Microscopes and telescopes. As any good scientist can tell you, these tools each have their uses, and to learn the most you need to know to use them both.\n\nThe microscope Bible Study tools are perhaps the more common ones.  TDNT, HALOT, BDAG – all kinds of tools exist that hone in on a single word and give great depth to each word. Like a microscope, these tools are at their best when they focus in on a single detail which has riches to unfold. Like a doctor studying a cell, the serious student of the Bible will be amazed at the universe hidden in such simple words as <em>telos</em>, <em>charis</em>, or <em>agape</em>.\n\nBut these Bible Study microscopes were never meant to be ends to themselves. After all, a cell unrelated to the rest of the organism is a quick candidate for death!  This is why good Bible Study should also use the telescope, too.  Telescopes, of course, help the astronomer to see very large things in closer detail. Commentaries, Concordances, sentence diagrams and even Systematic Theologies play a role in helping the student of the Bible to see how each part relates to the whole.\n\nEven a tool as humble as the outline can sometimes reveal insights unseen to the unaided eye. You probably know the story of Martha slaving away in the kitchen while Jesus sits at Mary’s feet. But do you know its context?  Luke 11 starts out Jesus famously summarizing the law as loving God and loving your neighbor.  Jesus then tells the story of the Good Samaritan to illustrate who our neighbor is.  But then Luke inserts the story of Mary and Martha.  Why?  Could it be that Luke realized the parallel of loving your neighbor, and then loving God?  How after all, do we love God, except by sitting at his feet and listening to what he says? (Interestingly enough, do you know what follows? It''s Luke''s version of the Lord''s Prayer.  If your God wants a relationship, how else but prayer?)\n\nSometimes, something as simple as asking, "What would I title this chapter?" yields insights into how each cell does its thing.\n\nSuch a Bible Study ‘aha’ becomes all the more precious when, as with a telescope, you see the whole picture in context – one theme building on another.  Don’t miss out in Bible Study; Use your microscope, but don’t forget the telescope, too!\n\nWhen one reads Scripture, one needs to always remember that every verse fits somewhere in context. It has been said that without context any verse can simply be used as pre-text.  On my home page, I have one of those “Verse a Day” gadgets that simply shows a single Bible verse.  One day, the verse was Matthew 4:9 "All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me."  I am sure that day some people saw that verse and thought, “See – if I worship God he will in face give me everything I desire!”  The “Name It &amp; Claim It” people were probably pretty happy that day.  But here''s a question for you? What is the context of that verse.  Go ahead – I''ll make it a question:\n\n1.              Who is the “he” [he said] in this Scripture and to whom is he talking?  What is the context of Matthew 4?\n\nAs good students of the Bible it is important that we are always aware of context. Ideally, whenever we read any verse (and ESPECIALLY when we memorize one!), we would know:\n\n–               something about the paragraph in which the verse appears\n\n–               something about the chapter in which the paragraph sits\n\n–               something about the book in which the chapter sits\n\n–               how that book fits in historically and within the whole redemption story.\n\nI''ll be honest, that takes work. Its hard to keep all of that in mind, and still plumb the depths of what God is trying to say.  So, how do I do it?  I''ll read a passage several times in order to really get to the meaning.\n\nRead #1: What is God trying to say in this particular passage?\n\nRead #2: What are some of the most important words? What do they mean?\n\nRead #3: What is the chapter as a whole about?\n\nThis month, let''s try doing Reads 1 &amp; 3 on Luke 16.  Let me give you the whole text. First, we''ll examine some of the parts, then we''ll go back and try to put the whole thing together.  I''ll divide it up into three sections.  Read each part first, then we''ll try to assemble the whole\n\n<em>Parable of the Shrewd Manager</em>\n\n16 Jesus told this story to his disciples: “There was a certain rich man who had a manager handling his affairs. One day a report came that the manager was wasting his employer’s money. <sup>2 </sup>So the employer called him in and said, ‘What’s this I hear about you? Get your report in order, because you are going to be fired.’\n\n<sup>3 </sup>“The manager thought to himself, ‘Now what? My boss has fired me. I don’t have the strength to dig ditches, and I’m too proud to beg. <sup>4 </sup>Ah, I know how to ensure that I’ll have plenty of friends who will give me a home when I am fired.’\n\n<sup>5 </sup>“So he invited each person who owed money to his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first one, ‘How much do you owe him?’ <sup>6 </sup>The man replied, ‘I owe him 800 gallons of olive oil.’ So the manager told him, ‘Take the bill and quickly change it to 400 gallons.<sup>*</sup>’\n\n<sup>7 </sup>“ ‘And how much do you owe my employer?’ he asked the next man. ‘I owe him 1,000 bushels of wheat,’ was the reply. ‘Here,’ the manager said, ‘take the bill and change it to 800 bushels.<sup>*</sup>’\n\n<sup>8 </sup>“The rich man had to admire the dishonest rascal for being so shrewd. And it is true that the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with the world around them than are the children of the light. <sup>9 </sup>Here’s the lesson: Use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends. Then, when your earthly possessions are gone, they will welcome you to an eternal home.\n\n2.              What type of literature is this?\n\n3.              What is the essential conflict of this story?\n\n4.              Does the “Shrewd Manager” act in a “Christian” manner? In other words, is he sinning? If so, how?\n\n5.              Is Jesus commending the sin?\n\n6.              What was Jesus happy about in this man’s actions?\n\n7.              What is the “lesson” that this parable teaches?\n\n<sup>10 </sup>“If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won’t be honest with greater responsibilities. <sup>11 </sup>And if you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with the true riches of heaven? <sup>12 </sup>And if you are not faithful with other people’s things, why should you be trusted with things of your own?\n\n<sup>13 </sup>“No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”\n\n<sup>14 </sup>The Pharisees, who dearly loved their money, heard all this and scoffed at him. <sup>15 </sup>Then he said to them, “You like to appear righteous in public, but God knows your hearts. What this world honors is detestable in the sight of God.\n\n<sup>16 </sup>“Until John the Baptist, the law of Moses and the messages of the prophets were your guides. But now the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is eager to get in. <sup>17 </sup>But that doesn’t mean that the law has lost its force. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest point of God’s law to be overturned.\n\n<sup>18 </sup>“For example, a man who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery. And anyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.”\n\n8.              What type of literature is this?\n\n9.              In verses 10-12, what does Jesus say about the role of money in this world?  Do the words “training wheels” make any sense in this regard?\n\n10.           In verse 13-15, what is the danger of money? Look up 1 Timothy 6:10 for a god parallel.\n\n11.           Is the Pharisee’s reaction in verse 14 understandable? Why would they scoff? What would that sound like in today’s words? Have I ever done that? [Ok, I’m stopping there!]\n\n12.           In verse 15, what does the world value? What does God, in contrast, value? Why are these in conflict?\n\nNow,  before we look at 16 – 18, I’ll also admit I had to scratch my head a bit and ask myself how this fits into this chapter. When I first read this bit, I read it in the ESV and the NIV before the NLT (which is what I tend to use here because of its readability.)  The point I’m wanting to make is this – reading in different translations will sometimes help you “get” a section, especially if a passage has you wondering.  If you are wondering about a particular passage, that’s always a good sign you should stop and investigate!\n\n13.           In verse 16, what is Jesus talking about when he uses the words “the law” and “the prophets”?\n\n14.           The end of verse 16 seems to imply that what Jesus is teaching [the Good News of the Kingdom of God] is somehow more popular than the “law and the prophets.”  Does that mean the Old Testament is irrelevant?\n\n15.           How does the example of adultery explain the permanence of the law?\n\nNow, just a little bit of hint and reflection here.  Is money a long-term thing? How about people? How about Scripture? Yes, I’m leading you here, but I want to again come back to what I was saying about “things that don’t fit should make you go back and think.”  I “knew” what the first parable was about and what the last story we’re going to read was about, until I had to ask myself, how does verse 18 fit?  When I asked myself that question, I realized I didn’t “know” as much as I thought.\n\nAnyways, the last bit:\n\n<strong>The Rich Man and Lazarus</strong>\n\n<strong><sup>19</sup></strong> “There was a rich man who was clothed in <em><sup>e</sup></em>purple and fine linen and <em><sup>f</sup></em>who feasted sumptuously every day. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong> And at his gate <em><sup>g</sup></em>was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong> who desired to be fed with <em><sup>h</sup></em>what fell from the rich man’s table.

And it is true that the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with the world around them than are the children of the light. <sup>9 </sup>Here’s the lesson: Use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends. Then, when your earthly possessions are gone, they will welcome you to an eternal home.\n\n2.              What type of literature is this?\n\n3.              What is the essential conflict of this story?\n\n4.              Does the “Shrewd Manager” act in a “Christian” manner? In other words, is he sinning? If so, how?\n\n5.              Is Jesus commending the sin?\n\n6.              What was Jesus happy about in this man’s actions?\n\n7.              What is the “lesson” that this parable teaches?\n\n<sup>10 </sup>“If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won’t be honest with greater responsibilities. <sup>11 </sup>And if you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with the true riches of heaven? <sup>12 </sup>And if you are not faithful with other people’s things, why should you be trusted with things of your own?\n\n<sup>13 </sup>“No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”\n\n<sup>14 </sup>The Pharisees, who dearly loved their money, heard all this and scoffed at him. <sup>15 </sup>Then he said to them, “You like to appear righteous in public, but God knows your hearts. What this world honors is detestable in the sight of God.\n\n<sup>16 </sup>“Until John the Baptist, the law of Moses and the messages of the prophets were your guides. But now the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is eager to get in. <sup>17 </sup>But that doesn’t mean that the law has lost its force. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest point of God’s law to be overturned.\n\n<sup>18 </sup>“For example, a man who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery. And anyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.”\n\n8.              What type of literature is this?\n\n9.              In verses 10-12, what does Jesus say about the role of money in this world?  Do the words “training wheels” make any sense in this regard?\n\n10.           In verse 13-15, what is the danger of money? Look up 1 Timothy 6:10 for a god parallel.\n\n11.           Is the Pharisee’s reaction in verse 14 understandable? Why would they scoff? What would that sound like in today’s words? Have I ever done that? [Ok, I’m stopping there!]\n\n12.           In verse 15, what does the world value? What does God, in contrast, value? Why are these in conflict?\n\nNow,  before we look at 16 – 18, I’ll also admit I had to scratch my head a bit and ask myself how this fits into this chapter. When I first read this bit, I read it in the ESV and the NIV before the NLT (which is what I tend to use here because of its readability.)  The point I’m wanting to make is this – reading in different translations will sometimes help you “get” a section, especially if a passage has you wondering.  If you are wondering about a particular passage, that’s always a good sign you should stop and investigate!\n\n13.           In verse 16, what is Jesus talking about when he uses the words “the law” and “the prophets”?\n\n14.           The end of verse 16 seems to imply that what Jesus is teaching [the Good News of the Kingdom of God] is somehow more popular than the “law and the prophets.”  Does that mean the Old Testament is irrelevant?\n\n15.           How does the example of adultery explain the permanence of the law?\n\nNow, just a little bit of hint and reflection here.  Is money a long-term thing? How about people? How about Scripture? Yes, I’m leading you here, but I want to again come back to what I was saying about “things that don’t fit should make you go back and think.”  I “knew” what the first parable was about and what the last story we’re going to read was about, until I had to ask myself, how does verse 18 fit?  When I asked myself that question, I realized I didn’t “know” as much as I thought.\n\nAnyways, the last bit:\n\n<strong>The Rich Man and Lazarus</strong>\n\n<strong><sup>19</sup></strong> “There was a rich man who was clothed in <em><sup>e</sup></em>purple and fine linen and <em><sup>f</sup></em>who feasted sumptuously every day. <strong><sup>20</sup></strong> And at his gate <em><sup>g</sup></em>was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, <strong><sup>21</sup></strong> who desired to be fed with <em><sup>h</sup></em>what fell from the rich man’s table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. <strong><sup>22</sup></strong> The poor man died and was carried by <em><sup>i</sup></em>the angels <em><sup>j</sup></em>to Abraham’s side.<em><sup>6</sup></em> The rich man also died and was buried, <strong><sup>23</sup></strong> and in <em><sup>k</sup></em>Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and <em><sup>l</sup></em>saw Abraham far off and Lazarus <em><sup>j</sup></em>at his side. <strong><sup>24</sup></strong> And he called out, <em><sup>m</sup></em>‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and <em><sup>n</sup></em>cool my tongue, for <em><sup>o</sup></em>I am in anguish in this flame.’ <strong><sup>25</sup></strong> But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that <em><sup>p</sup></em>you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. <strong><sup>26</sup></strong> And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’ <strong><sup>27</sup></strong> And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father’s house— <strong><sup>28</sup></strong> for I have five brothers<em><sup>7</sup></em>—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ <strong><sup>29</sup></strong> But Abraham said, ‘They have <em><sup>q</sup></em>Moses and the Prophets; <em><sup>r</sup></em>let them hear them.’ <strong><sup>30</sup></strong> And he said, ‘No, <em><sup>s</sup></em>father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ <strong><sup>31</sup></strong> He said to him, ‘If they do not hear <em><sup>q</sup></em>Moses and the Prophets, <em><sup>t</sup></em>neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’ ” <a href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>\n\n16.           What type of literature is this?\n\nDon’t skip over that question, because frankly, Christians have been divided over that question for a long time. It’s easy to think this is a parable, because it has a pretty strong point and the story can easily be thought of as a set of fantastic stereotypes.  Because it talks about heaven and hell, which are hard for us to grasp, it’s easier for some people to “dismiss” this as parable. On the other hand, unlike every other parable, Jesus actually names the characters, and unlike every other parable it does NOT liken a situation to something that the hearers would identify with.\n\n17.           Does thinking of this as a parable or reality change your perception in any way?\n\n18.           How did the rich man live? How did Lazarus live?\n\n19.           Where did the rich man go in death? Where did Lazarus go in death?\n\n20.           Are there other people with Lazarus? How about the rich man?\n\n21.           Is it possible for those in heaven to reach those in Hell?\n\n22.           How can there be a place where God cannot go?  [Talk to the Gateway kids about <em>The Great Divorce!!!</em>]\n\n23.           So, contrary to the popular notion that “Hell is a great place to party,” how does Lazarus speak of his torment? What is his plea?\n\n24.           What is Abraham’s response? Do we in fact have the things he says they already have?\n\n25.           In verse 30, is that completely true?\n\n26.           What is Jesus implying about how the rich man should have acted?\n\n27.           What is Jesus implying about the Scriptures?\n\nOkay, now that we have read all this, it’s back to context.  I should say that Luke 15 is the Parable of the Prodigal Son (or the Parable of the Loving Father or the Parable of the Older Brother depending on how you want to call it.)  Luke 17 is getting into Jesus’ final teachings as he heads to the Cross.  The question we want to get at is, what is Luke 16 teaching us?\n\n28.           What are some of the common themes?\n\n29.           So, you have NO MORE THAN 10 words.  What is the point of Luke 16?\n\nHere’s mine, but it isn’t the only one:\n\nLove Lasts; Wealth doesn’t.

Yes, the Bible is a collection of books, and many of the books can in turn be studied as a collection of stories, songs, sayings, or whatever – but what is easy to miss sight of is the fact that the Bible is in fact the sum of its parts.\r\n\r\nAs a cheap aside, I wrote the following “essay” a few years back in order to get some free books for my Bible software, but I think it''s still worth reading: (Nice formatting at http://www.logos.com/nationalbibleweek/biblestudy/54)\r\n\r\nBible Study with the Telescope and the Microscope\r\n\r\nWhen we sit down to do serious Bible Study, we have all sorts of tools available to aid us in making discoveries. But generally these Bible Study tools fall into two categories – Microscopes and telescopes. As any good scientist can tell you, these tools each have their uses, and to learn the most you need to know to use them both.\r\n\r\nThe microscope Bible Study tools are perhaps the more common ones.  TDNT, HALOT, BDAG – all kinds of tools exist that hone in on a single word and give great depth to each word. Like a microscope, these tools are at their best when they focus in on a single detail which has riches to unfold. Like a doctor studying a cell, the serious student of the Bible will be amazed at the universe hidden in such simple words as <em>telos</em>, <em>charis</em>, or <em>agape</em>.\r\n\r\nBut these Bible Study microscopes were never meant to be ends to themselves. After all, a cell unrelated to the rest of the organism is a quick candidate for death!  This is why good Bible Study should also use the telescope, too.  Telescopes, of course, help the astronomer to see very large things in closer detail. Commentaries, Concordances, sentence diagrams and even Systematic Theologies play a role in helping the student of the Bible to see how each part relates to the whole.\r\n\r\nEven a tool as humble as the outline can sometimes reveal insights unseen to the unaided eye. You probably know the story of Martha slaving away in the kitchen while Jesus sits at Mary’s feet. But do you know its context?  Luke 11 starts out Jesus famously summarizing the law as loving God and loving your neighbor.  Jesus then tells the story of the Good Samaritan to illustrate who our neighbor is.  But then Luke inserts the story of Mary and Martha.  Why?  Could it be that Luke realized the parallel of loving your neighbor, and then loving God?  How after all, do we love God, except by sitting at his feet and listening to what he says? (Interestingly enough, do you know what follows? It''s Luke''s version of the Lord''s Prayer.  If your God wants a relationship, how else but prayer?)\r\n\r\nSometimes, something as simple as asking, "What would I title this chapter?" yields insights into how each cell does its thing.\r\n\r\nSuch a Bible Study ‘aha’ becomes all the more precious when, as with a telescope, you see the whole picture in context – one theme building on another.  Don’t miss out in Bible Study; Use your microscope, but don’t forget the telescope, too!\r\n\r\nWhen one reads Scripture, one needs to always remember that every verse fits somewhere in context. It has been said that without context any verse can simply be used as pre-text.  On my home page, I have one of those “Verse a Day” gadgets that simply shows a single Bible verse.  One day, the verse was Matthew 4:9 "All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me."  I am sure that day some people saw that verse and thought, “See – if I worship God he will in face give me everything I desire!”  The “Name It &amp; Claim It” people were probably pretty happy that day.  But here''s a question for you? What is the context of that verse.  Go ahead – I''ll make it a question:\r\n\r\n1.              Who is the “he” [he said] in this Scripture and to whom is he talking?  What is the context of Matthew 4?\r\n\r\nAs good students of the Bible it is important that we are always aware of context. Ideally, whenever we read any verse (and ESPECIALLY when we memorize one!), we would know:\r\n\r\n–               something about the paragraph in which the verse appears\r\n\r\n–               something about the chapter in which the paragraph sits\r\n\r\n–               something about the book in which the chapter sits\r\n\r\n–               how that book fits in historically and within the whole redemption story.\r\n\r\nI''ll be honest, that takes work. Its hard to keep all of that in mind, and still plumb the depths of what God is trying to say.  So, how do I do it?  I''ll read a passage several times in order to really get to the meaning.\r\n\r\nRead #1: What is God trying to say in this particular passage?\r\n\r\nRead #2: What are some of the most important words? What do they mean?\r\n\r\nRead #3: What is the chapter as a whole about?\r\n\r\nThis month, let''s try doing Reads 1 &amp; 3 on Luke 16.  Let me give you the whole text. First, we''ll examine some of the parts, then we''ll go back and try to put the whole thing together.  I''ll divide it up into three sections.  Read each part first, then we''ll try to assemble the whole\r\n\r\n<em>Parable of the Shrewd Manager</em>\r\n\r\n16 Jesus told this story to his disciples: “There was a certain rich man who had a manager handling his affairs. One day a report came that the manager was wasting his employer’s money. <sup>2 </sup>So the employer called him in and said, ‘What’s this I hear about you? Get your report in order, because you are going to be fired.’\r\n\r\n<sup>3 </sup>“The manager thought to himself, ‘Now what? My boss has fired me. I don’t have the strength to dig ditches, and I’m too proud to beg. <sup>4 </sup>Ah, I know how to ensure that I’ll have plenty of friends who will give me a home when I am fired.’\r\n\r\n<sup>5 </sup>“So he invited each person who owed money to his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first one, ‘How much do you owe him?’ <sup>6 </sup>The man replied, ‘I owe him 800 gallons of olive oil.’ So the manager told him, ‘Take the bill and quickly change it to 400 gallons.<sup>*</sup>’\r\n\r\n<sup>7 </sup>“ ‘And how much do you owe my employer?’ he asked the next man. ‘I owe him 1,000 bushels of wheat,’ was the reply. ‘Here,’ the manager said, ‘take the bill and change it to 800 bushels.<sup>*</sup>’\r\n\r\n<sup>8 </sup>“The rich man had to admire the dishonest rascal for being so shrewd. And it is true that the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with the world around them than are the children of the light. <sup>9 </sup>Here’s the lesson: Use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends. Then, when your earthly possessions are gone, they will welcome you to an eternal home.\r\n\r\n2.              What type of literature is this?\r\n\r\n3.              What is the essential conflict of this story?\r\n\r\n4.              Does the “Shrewd Manager” act in a “Christian” manner? In other words, is he sinning? If so, how?\r\n\r\n5.              Is Jesus commending the sin?\r\n\r\n6.              What was Jesus happy about in this man’s actions?\r\n\r\n7.              What is the “lesson” that this parable teaches?\r\n\r\n<sup>10 </sup>“If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won’t be honest with greater responsibilities. <sup>11 </sup>And if you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with the true riches of heaven? <sup>12 </sup>And if you are not faithful with other people’s things, why should you be trusted with things of your own?\r\n\r\n<sup>13 </sup>“No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”\r\n\r\n<sup>14 </sup>The Pharisees, who dearly loved their money, heard all this and scoffed at him. <sup>15 </sup>Then he said to them, “You like to appear righteous in public, but God knows your hearts.

It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest point of God’s law to be overturned.\r\n\r\n<sup>18 </sup>“For example, a man who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery. And anyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.”\r\n\r\n8.              What type of literature is this?\r\n\r\n9.              In verses 10-12, what does Jesus say about the role of money in this world?  Do the words “training wheels” make any sense in this regard?\r\n\r\n10.           In verse 13-15, what is the danger of money?

Have I ever done that? [Ok, I’m stopping there!]\r\n\r\n12.           In verse 15, what does the world value? What does God, in contrast, value? Why are these in conflict?\r\n\r\nNow,  before we look at 16 – 18, I’ll also admit I had to scratch my head a bit and ask myself how this fits into this chapter.

It says who the letter is addressed to and who it is from. (2) is the point of the letter. Thank you letters have a very definite reason for being – My parents said, “You need to write a thank you letter.”  Line 2 is an acknowledgement that I have done what they told me to do, and now I can get back to playing with the ___ they gave me.  (3) is the hard part of the thank you letter.  I suspect you know the feeling.  You’ve gotten through the stuff that’s always in a letter, and now comes the hard part. You have the fill up the rest of the card.  What do you say? In my case, just about anything that would fill up the card!\r\n\r\nAs I got older, the form didn’t change that much, although I hope the following shows some improvement:\r\n\r\n<em>(1)Dear Jean,</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(2) Thank you so much for the Alton Brown cookbook you gave Susan for Christmas.(3) I don’t know if you realize this – but you have a gift for knowing exactly what to give at Christmas.

(4) I have to tell you, I spent more time poring over Susan’s gift than the stuff people gave me from my list!  I am a huge Good Eats fan, and have spent many a time trying to copy down his ‘applications.'' The book you sent me is going to stay right in the kitchen. I’ll be thinking about you at dinner for a long time to come. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>(5)Thanks again, Michael.</em>\r\n\r\nNotice how little the form has really changed.  (1) &amp; (5) are the same, and the point of the letter (2) is still the first thing I say.  What has changed is that I have learned that the filling of a thank you letter really isn’t as much about the point as it is about the relationship. Notice in (3) I am telling Jean something she may or may not know, but something that characterizes our relationship.  She really is amazingly good at picking out presents, as my kids and I can both attest. I really don’t have to tell her all the gifts she’s given me – she knows that because of our past relationship.  (4) is a little slice of information that is indicative of how our relationship has grown through that gift (She lives in Richmond so she needs me to articulate that!) but it is by no means everything. The point of writing the letter has changed a bit – and I think for the better – because I have learned that a note must be in the context of a relationship, and the point is to talk about the relationship over the information.\r\n\r\nMost of the “books” of the New Testament are actually letters, not too unlike thank you notes. If we called them “letters,” they wouldn’t sound so grand – so they’re called “epistles,” but they mean the exact same thing.  Just like thank you notes, “epistles” have a very standard structure.  I’m going to have you read one such letter – the book of Second John.  One point of clarification: There are actually four books in the NT called John (and a fifth one he wrote called Revelation!) – There is the <em>Gospel</em> of John which we’ll talk about later, and then three letters from John called, oddly enough 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John. It is common to mix them up – but remember that the Gospel of John is a big old story at the beginning of the NT, and his letters are much, much shorter and towards the end.  I have removed the verse numbers, but there are a few points I want to come back to, so I’ve inserted my own numbers.\r\n\r\nAnyways, enough with the commentary, let’s read.\r\n\r\n(1)   This letter is from John, the elder.\r\n\r\n(2)   I am writing to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in the truth—as does everyone else who knows the truth— <sup> </sup>because the truth lives in us and will be with us forever.\r\n\r\n(3)   Grace, mercy, and peace, which come from God the Father and from Jesus Christ—the Son of the Father—will continue to be with us who live in truth and love.\r\n\r\n(4)   How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living according to the truth, just as the Father commanded. <sup> </sup>\r\n\r\n(5)   I am writing to remind you, dear friends, that we should love one another. This is not a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning. Love means doing what God has commanded us, and he has commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning.\r\n\r\n(6)   I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world. They deny that Jesus Christ came in a real body. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist.<sup> </sup>Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked so hard to achieve. Be diligent so that you receive your full reward. <sup> </sup>\r\n\r\n(7)   Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God. But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son.\r\n\r\nIf anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ, don’t invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement. Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work.\r\n\r\n(8)   I have much more to say to you, but I don’t want to do it with paper and ink. For I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face. Then our joy will be complete.\r\n\r\n(9)   Greetings from the children of your sister, chosen by God.\r\n\r\nThat’s it!  Guess what. Of the 66 books of the bible, no matter what else, you have read a full book of the Bible today.  One of the first things you should note is this: Most of the books of the New Testament are very, very short. You can most of them in just a few minutes.  And, before you delve too much into any one part, you really should.\r\n\r\nNow that you’ve read it, let’s answer a few questions.\r\n\r\n1.     When John says he’s writing this “to the Chosen Lady and her children,” (2) who do you think he’s talking about?  (Hint: Revelation 21:2, also written by John, uses the same sort of language)\r\n\r\nObviously (1) &amp; (2) are like the Dear X &amp; Sincerely, Y of our letters.  Back then, you put that at the very top, because there were no envelopes (paper was expensive!) and you didn’t want to have to read the whole thing to deliver it!  Part (3) is equally as formulaic – it’s sort of like an extended “Hello,” and (9) is a standard goodbye.  You’ll find that these parts in every epistle.    It’s important to understand the formula, because these set the context, but you don’t want to get lost in them.\r\n\r\n2.     As an “extra credit” exercise, flip through the ‘epistles’ and fill out this basic chart:\r\n<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top"><strong>Book</strong></td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"><strong>From</strong></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"><strong>To</strong></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top"><strong>Who is that?</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">Romans</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Italy<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">1 &amp; 2 Corinthians</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Greece</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">Galatians</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">Several churches in Central Turkey<sup>1</sup></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">Ephesians</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church on the Turkish coast<sup>1</sup></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">Phillipians</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Northern Greece</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">Colossians</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Central Turkey<sup>1</sup></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Northern Greece</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">I &amp; 2 Timothy</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">His protégé</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">Titus</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">A pastor he knew</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width="95" valign="top">Philemon</td>\r\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\r\n<td width="203" valign="top">A slaveowner</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan="4" width="479" valign="top"><em>Notice I am skipping Hebrews – Hebrews   is not really a letter so much as a sermon.

(Hint: If you''re Bible has some maps at the end, take a look)\r\n\r\nBy the way, I’m purposely trying to focus you on the ‘formula’ for a bit so that frankly you can know what not to pay too much attention to.  I’m not saying you should ignore – because you need to know the context in which the book was written, but you don’t need to be looking for theology in those places as much as context.  One very helpful thing to do if you find yourself a little stuck at the beginning or the end of a letter is to read a quick Bible Overview synopsis, usually found in many Study Bibles, to get that ‘context.’ Anyways – that’s my overview of ‘all’ the letters. Let’s get back to 2 John. Specifically, go back and look at (4).\r\n\r\n4.     What kind of relationship does John have with these people?\r\n\r\n5.     What does he do first? Why is that important? Is there a pattern we can apply to our own lives based on the “nature” of that interaction?\r\n\r\nLook again at (5).\r\n\r\n6.     What is it that John wants these people to do?  Does he give a practical example of that earlier in this letter?\r\n\r\n7.     Look at John 13:34. When, where and from whom did John first get this “command?”\r\n\r\n8.     Look at John 14:15. What is the basis for our obedience to Christ?\r\n\r\n9.     What is the difference between these two statements:\r\n- If you love me, keep my commandments\r\n- If you keep my commandments, I will love you.\r\n\r\n10.  Which one is the Biblical teaching? What difference does that make in how we approach Christ?\r\n\r\n11.  What is love? (Yeah, I know – that’s an easy one… NOT!)\r\n\r\nLook again at (6).\r\n\r\n12.  Does there seem to be a change in tone? Why? How can this be consistent with (5)?\r\n\r\n13.  What is the reward that John is afraid his church would lose?\r\n\r\n14.  Why is it that encouraging unbelievers would be unloving?\r\n\r\nLook again at (7).  Notice here that John is going to give some practical advice on the implications of (6). This is normal in just about every epistle in the Bible. There is a greeting (1-3) and a relationship(4). That is followed generally by a specific point that the writer really wants the recipient to get (5). Usually this is done because there is some kind of a problem (6) that could really screw things up.  But high-minded theology needs to be worked out in simple, practical, concrete applications, like in (7).\r\n\r\nIf you were to go back and read 2 Timothy, for example (and it’s a very good book – and almost as short), you’ll see this same pattern.  Paul – about ready to be killed incidently – writes a letter to Timothy. You will see Paul &amp; Timothy’s relationship, and then you will see that the entire letter can be boiled down to 2 Timothy 1:14 – HOLD FAST TO THAT WHICH YOU HAVE. But that principle is only as good as how well you see that borne out in day to day stuff.  The rest of the book are some suggestions on how that happens.\r\n\r\nBack in 2 John, in my (7) ask yourself:\r\n\r\n15.  What is this “relationship” anyway?\r\n\r\n16.  How do you know when love means to be in relationship and when it does not?\r\n\r\n17.  Again, why is it loving to <em>not </em> encourage someone who is anti-Christ?\r\n\r\nFinally, just a note about (8).\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth thinking through in (8) what John – one of the Twelve remember, a very busy man – thought about the in-person component of being church with other believers. Clearly he could write – but he sees the in-person part as the more important thing to do.  Any implications you take from that are your own J\r\n\r\nJohn clearly has more that he could say. Do you feel a little gipped that he doesn’t say it? Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a how-to manual for every action we would take?  But then again, is God’s purpose really to give a set of rules and regulations, or is it to have relationship with us?\r\n\r\nJust imagine, for instance, if I had a computer simulation from Susan, one which would tell me the appropriate answer for every situation, like when she asks, “Does this dress make me look fat?” Even if I knew the correct answer<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> to every situation, how would I start feel about that relationship, every time the program chimed in with the answer?\r\n\r\nIf God’s plan is that our joy might be complete, is a how-to manual really the right answer?\r\n\r\nYes, we can reduce what we read to principles and even applications for how we should behave – but ask yourself this: Is that all that Bible Study is? Is not perhaps a means of just enjoying a relationship with the God who inspired each of these letters? The point of Susan asking me about the dress has nothing to do with how she looks – it’s about the fact that I’m looking at her.\r\n\r\nOnce more, thanks everyone, and looking forward to seeing you on January 10, 2010.\r\n\r\n<hr size="1" /><a href="#_ftnref">[1]</a> I have pictures if you want.

You can most of them in just a few minutes.  And, before you delve too much into any one part, you really should.\n\nNow that you’ve read it, let’s answer a few questions.\n\n1.     When John says he’s writing this “to the Chosen Lady and her children,” (2) who do you think he’s talking about?  (Hint: Revelation 21:2, also written by John, uses the same sort of language)\n\nObviously (1) &amp; (2) are like the Dear X &amp; Sincerely, Y of our letters.  Back then, you put that at the very top, because there were no envelopes (paper was expensive!) and you didn’t want to have to read the whole thing to deliver it!  Part (3) is equally as formulaic – it’s sort of like an extended “Hello,” and (9) is a standard goodbye.  You’ll find that these parts in every epistle.    It’s important to understand the formula, because these set the context, but you don’t want to get lost in them.\n\n2.     As an “extra credit” exercise, flip through the ‘epistles’ and fill out this basic chart:\n<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top"><strong>Book</strong></td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"><strong>From</strong></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"><strong>To</strong></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top"><strong>Who is that?</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">Romans</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Italy<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">1 &amp; 2 Corinthians</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Greece</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">Galatians</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">Several churches in Central Turkey<sup>1</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">Ephesians</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church on the Turkish coast<sup>1</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">Phillipians</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Northern Greece</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">Colossians</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Central Turkey<sup>1</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">A church in Northern Greece</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">I &amp; 2 Timothy</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">His protégé</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">Titus</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">A pastor he knew</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="95" valign="top">Philemon</td>\n<td width="99" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="81" valign="top"></td>\n<td width="203" valign="top">A slaveowner</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="4" width="479" valign="top"><em>Notice I am skipping Hebrews – Hebrews   is not really a letter so much as a sermon.

(Hint: If you''re Bible has some maps at the end, take a look)\n\nBy the way, I’m purposely trying to focus you on the ‘formula’ for a bit so that frankly you can know what not to pay too much attention to.  I’m not saying you should ignore – because you need to know the context in which the book was written, but you don’t need to be looking for theology in those places as much as context.  One very helpful thing to do if you find yourself a little stuck at the beginning or the end of a letter is to read a quick Bible Overview synopsis, usually found in many Study Bibles, to get that ‘context.’ Anyways – that’s my overview of ‘all’ the letters. Let’s get back to 2 John. Specifically, go back and look at (4).\n\n4.     What kind of relationship does John have with these people?\n\n5.     What does he do first? Why is that important? Is there a pattern we can apply to our own lives based on the “nature” of that interaction?\n\nLook again at (5).\n\n6.     What is it that John wants these people to do?  Does he give a practical example of that earlier in this letter?\n\n7.     Look at John 13:34. When, where and from whom did John first get this “command?”\n\n8.     Look at John 14:15. What is the basis for our obedience to Christ?\n\n9.     What is the difference between these two statements:\n- If you love me, keep my commandments\n- If you keep my commandments, I will love you.\n\n10.  Which one is the Biblical teaching? What difference does that make in how we approach Christ?\n\n11.  What is love? (Yeah, I know – that’s an easy one… NOT!)\n\nLook again at (6).\n\n12.  Does there seem to be a change in tone? Why? How can this be consistent with (5)?\n\n13.  What is the reward that John is afraid his church would lose?\n\n14.  Why is it that encouraging unbelievers would be unloving?\n\nLook again at (7).  Notice here that John is going to give some practical advice on the implications of (6). This is normal in just about every epistle in the Bible. There is a greeting (1-3) and a relationship(4). That is followed generally by a specific point that the writer really wants the recipient to get (5). Usually this is done because there is some kind of a problem (6) that could really screw things up.  But high-minded theology needs to be worked out in simple, practical, concrete applications, like in (7).\n\nIf you were to go back and read 2 Timothy, for example (and it’s a very good book – and almost as short), you’ll see this same pattern.  Paul – about ready to be killed incidently – writes a letter to Timothy. You will see Paul &amp; Timothy’s relationship, and then you will see that the entire letter can be boiled down to 2 Timothy 1:14 – HOLD FAST TO THAT WHICH YOU HAVE. But that principle is only as good as how well you see that borne out in day to day stuff.  The rest of the book are some suggestions on how that happens.\n\nBack in 2 John, in my (7) ask yourself:\n\n15.  What is this “relationship” anyway?\n\n16.  How do you know when love means to be in relationship and when it does not?\n\n17.  Again, why is it loving to <em>not </em> encourage someone who is anti-Christ?\n\nFinally, just a note about (8).\n\nIt’s also worth thinking through in (8) what John – one of the Twelve remember, a very busy man – thought about the in-person component of being church with other believers. Clearly he could write – but he sees the in-person part as the more important thing to do.  Any implications you take from that are your own J\n\nJohn clearly has more that he could say. Do you feel a little gipped that he doesn’t say it? Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a how-to manual for every action we would take?  But then again, is God’s purpose really to give a set of rules and regulations, or is it to have relationship with us?\n\nJust imagine, for instance, if I had a computer simulation from Susan, one which would tell me the appropriate answer for every situation, like when she asks, “Does this dress make me look fat?” Even if I knew the correct answer<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> to every situation, how would I start feel about that relationship, every time the program chimed in with the answer?\n\nIf God’s plan is that our joy might be complete, is a how-to manual really the right answer?\n\nYes, we can reduce what we read to principles and even applications for how we should behave – but ask yourself this: Is that all that Bible Study is? Is not perhaps a means of just enjoying a relationship with the God who inspired each of these letters? The point of Susan asking me about the dress has nothing to do with how she looks – it’s about the fact that I’m looking at her.\n\nOnce more, thanks everyone, and looking forward to seeing you on January 10, 2010.\n\n<hr size="1" /><a href="#_ftnref">[1]</a> I have pictures if you want.

It’s great. It’s fun to play with. Thank you very much.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(4) </em><em>Sincerely, Michael</em>\r\n\r\nSo, a few notes.  (1) &amp; (4) are your clues that this is a letter. It says who the letter is addressed to and who it is from. (2) is the point of the letter. Thank you letters have a very definite reason for being – My parents said, “You need to write a thank you letter.”  Line 2 is an acknowledgement that I have done what they told me to do, and now I can get back to playing with the ___ they gave me.  (3) is the hard part of the thank you letter.  I suspect you know the feeling.  You’ve gotten through the stuff that’s always in a letter, and now comes the hard part. You have the fill up the rest of the card.  What do you say? In my case, just about anything that would fill up the card!\r\n\r\nAs I got older, the form didn’t change that much, although I hope the following shows some improvement:\r\n\r\n<em>(1)Dear Jean,</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(2) Thank you so much for the Alton Brown cookbook you gave Susan for Christmas.(3) I don’t know if you realize this – but you have a gift for knowing exactly what to give at Christmas. Every year you seem to pick that one thing I never would have put on my list, but the thing that makes me smile the most. (4) I have to tell you, I spent more time poring over Susan’s gift than the stuff people gave me from my list!  I am a huge Good Eats fan, and have spent many a time trying to copy down his ‘applications.'' The book you sent me is going to stay right in the kitchen. I’ll be thinking about you at dinner for a long time to come. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>(5)Thanks again, Michael.</em>\r\n\r\nNotice how little the form has really changed.  (1) &amp; (5) are the same, and the point of the letter (2) is still the first thing I say.  What has changed is that I have learned that the filling of a thank you letter really isn’t as much about the point as it is about the relationship. Notice in (3) I am telling Jean something she may or may not know, but something that characterizes our relationship.  She really is amazingly good at picking out presents, as my kids and I can both attest. I really don’t have to tell her all the gifts she’s given me – she knows that because of our past relationship.  (4) is a little slice of information that is indicative of how our relationship has grown through that gift (She lives in Richmond so she needs me to articulate that!) but it is by no means everything. The point of writing the letter has changed a bit – and I think for the better – because I have learned that a note must be in the context of a relationship, and the point is to talk about the relationship over the information.\r\n\r\nMost of the “books” of the New Testament are actually letters, not too unlike thank you notes. If we called them “letters,” they wouldn’t sound so grand – so they’re called “epistles,” but they mean the exact same thing.  Just like thank you notes, “epistles” have a very standard structure.  I’m going to have you read one such letter – the book of Second John.  One point of clarification: There are actually four books in the NT called John (and a fifth one he wrote called Revelation!) – There is the <em>Gospel</em> of John which we’ll talk about later, and then three letters from John called, oddly enough 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John. It is common to mix them up – but remember that the Gospel of John is a big old story at the beginning of the NT, and his letters are much, much shorter and towards the end.  I have removed the verse numbers, but there are a few points I want to come back to, so I’ve inserted my own numbers.\r\n\r\nAnyways, enough with the commentary, let’s read.\r\n\r\n(1)   This letter is from John, the elder.\r\n\r\n(2)   I am writing to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in the truth—as does everyone else who knows the truth— <sup> </sup>because the truth lives in us and will be with us forever.\r\n\r\n(3)   Grace, mercy, and peace, which come from God the Father and from Jesus Christ—the Son of the Father—will continue to be with us who live in truth and love.\r\n\r\n(4)   How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living according to the truth, just as the Father commanded. <sup> </sup>\r\n\r\n(5)   I am writing to remind you, dear friends, that we should love one another. This is not a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning. Love means doing what God has commanded us, and he has commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning.\r\n\r\n(6)   I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world. They deny that Jesus Christ came in a real body. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist.<sup> </sup>Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked so hard to achieve. Be diligent so that you receive your full reward. <sup> </sup>\r\n\r\n(7)   Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God. But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son.\r\n\r\nIf anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ, don’t invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement. Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work.\r\n\r\n(8)   I have much more to say to you, but I don’t want to do it with paper and ink. For I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face. Then our joy will be complete.\r\n\r\n(9)   Greetings from the children of your sister, chosen by God.\r\n\r\nThat’s it!  Guess what.

(Hint: If you''re Bible has some maps at the end, take a look)\r\n\r\nBy the way, I’m purposely trying to focus you on the ‘formula’ for a bit so that frankly you can know what not to pay too much attention to.  I’m not saying you should ignore – because you need to know the context in which the book was written, but you don’t need to be looking for theology in those places as much as context.  One very helpful thing to do if you find yourself a little stuck at the beginning or the end of a letter is to read a quick Bible Overview synopsis, usually found in many Study Bibles, to get that ‘context.’ Anyways – that’s my overview of ‘all’ the letters. Let’s get back to 2 John. Specifically, go back and look at (4).\r\n\r\n4.     What kind of relationship does John have with these people?\r\n\r\n5.     What does he do first? Why is that important? Is there a pattern we can apply to our own lives based on the “nature” of that interaction?\r\n\r\nLook again at (5).\r\n\r\n6.     What is it that John wants these people to do?  Does he give a practical example of that earlier in this letter?\r\n\r\n7.     Look at John 13:34. When, where and from whom did John first get this “command?”\r\n\r\n8.     Look at John 14:15. What is the basis for our obedience to Christ?\r\n\r\n9.     What is the difference between these two statements:\r\n- If you love me, keep my commandments\r\n- If you keep my commandments, I will love you.\r\n\r\n10.  Which one is the Biblical teaching? What difference does that make in how we approach Christ?\r\n\r\n11.  What is love? (Yeah, I know – that’s an easy one… NOT!)\r\n\r\nLook again at (6).\r\n\r\n12.  Does there seem to be a change in tone? Why? How can this be consistent with (5)?\r\n\r\n13.  What is the reward that John is afraid his church would lose?\r\n\r\n14.  Why is it that encouraging unbelievers would be unloving?\r\n\r\nLook again at (7).  Notice here that John is going to give some practical advice on the implications of (6). This is normal in just about every epistle in the Bible. There is a greeting (1-3) and a relationship(4). That is followed generally by a specific point that the writer really wants the recipient to get (5). Usually this is done because there is some kind of a problem (6) that could really screw things up.  But high-minded theology needs to be worked out in simple, practical, concrete applications, like in (7).\r\n\r\nIf you were to go back and read 2 Timothy, for example (and it’s a very good book – and almost as short), you’ll see this same pattern.  Paul – about ready to be killed incidently – writes a letter to Timothy. You will see Paul &amp; Timothy’s relationship, and then you will see that the entire letter can be boiled down to 2 Timothy 1:14 – HOLD FAST TO THAT WHICH YOU HAVE. But that principle is only as good as how well you see that borne out in day to day stuff.  The rest of the book are some suggestions on how that happens.\r\n\r\nBack in 2 John, in my (7) ask yourself:\r\n\r\n15.  What is this “relationship” anyway?\r\n\r\n16.  How do you know when love means to be in relationship and when it does not?\r\n\r\n17.  Again, why is it loving to <em>not </em> encourage someone who is anti-Christ?\r\n\r\nFinally, just a note about (8).\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth thinking through in (8) what John – one of the Twelve remember, a very busy man – thought about the in-person component of being church with other believers. Clearly he could write – but he sees the in-person part as the more important thing to do.  Any implications you take from that are your own J\r\n\r\nJohn clearly has more that he could say. Do you feel a little gipped that he doesn’t say it? Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a how-to manual for every action we would take?  But then again, is God’s purpose really to give a set of rules and regulations, or is it to have relationship with us?\r\n\r\nJust imagine, for instance, if I had a computer simulation from Susan, one which would tell me the appropriate answer for every situation, like when she asks, “Does this dress make me look fat?” Even if I knew the correct answer<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> to every situation, how would I start feel about that relationship, every time the program chimed in with the answer?\r\n\r\nIf God’s plan is that our joy might be complete, is a how-to manual really the right answer?\r\n\r\nYes, we can reduce what we read to principles and even applications for how we should behave – but ask yourself this: Is that all that Bible Study is? Is not perhaps a means of just enjoying a relationship with the God who inspired each of these letters? The point of Susan asking me about the dress has nothing to do with how she looks – it’s about the fact that I’m looking at her.\r\n\r\nOnce more, thanks everyone, and looking forward to seeing you on January 10, 2010.\r\n\r\n<hr size="1" /><a href="#_ftnref">[1]</a> I have pictures if you want.

(302, 1, '2010-10-30 16:22:10', '2010-10-30 21:22:10', 'Every year after Christmas, it was time to write thank you notes.  When I first started writing thank you notes, they looked like the following, minus the verse numbers I’m adding to ease discussion:\r\n\r\n<em>(1) </em><em>Dear Aunt X and Uncle Y,</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(2) </em><em> Thank you for the ____ you gave me for Christmas. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>(3) </em><em> I like it a lot. It’s great. It’s fun to play with. Thank you very much.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(4) </em><em>Sincerely, Michael</em>\r\n\r\nSo, a few notes.  (1) &amp; (4) are your clues that this is a letter. It says who the letter is addressed to and who it is from. (2) is the point of the letter. Thank you letters have a very definite reason for being – My parents said, “You need to write a thank you letter.”  Line 2 is an acknowledgement that I have done what they told me to do, and now I can get back to playing with the ___ they gave me.  (3) is the hard part of the thank you letter.  I suspect you know the feeling.  You’ve gotten through the stuff that’s always in a letter, and now comes the hard part. You have the fill up the rest of the card.  What do you say? In my case, just about anything that would fill up the card!\r\n\r\nAs I got older, the form didn’t change that much, although I hope the following shows some improvement:\r\n\r\n<em>(1)Dear Jean,</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(2) Thank you so much for the Alton Brown cookbook you gave Susan for Christmas.(3) I don’t know if you realize this – but you have a gift for knowing exactly what to give at Christmas. Every year you seem to pick that one thing I never would have put on my list, but the thing that makes me smile the most. (4) I have to tell you, I spent more time poring over Susan’s gift than the stuff people gave me from my list!  I am a huge Good Eats fan, and have spent many a time trying to copy down his ‘applications.'' The book you sent me is going to stay right in the kitchen. I’ll be thinking about you at dinner for a long time to come. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>(5)Thanks again, Michael.</em>\r\n\r\nNotice how little the form has really changed.  (1) &amp; (5) are the same, and the point of the letter (2) is still the first thing I say.  What has changed is that I have learned that the filling of a thank you letter really isn’t as much about the point as it is about the relationship. Notice in (3) I am telling Jean something she may or may not know, but something that characterizes our relationship.  She really is amazingly good at picking out presents, as my kids and I can both attest. I really don’t have to tell her all the gifts she’s given me – she knows that because of our past relationship.  (4) is a little slice of information that is indicative of how our relationship has grown through that gift (She lives in Richmond so she needs me to articulate that!) but it is by no means everything. The point of writing the letter has changed a bit – and I think for the better – because I have learned that a note must be in the context of a relationship, and the point is to talk about the relationship over the information.\r\n\r\nMost of the “books” of the New Testament are actually letters, not too unlike thank you notes. If we called them “letters,” they wouldn’t sound so grand – so they’re called “epistles,” but they mean the exact same thing.  Just like thank you notes, “epistles” have a very standard structure.  I’m going to have you read one such letter – the book of Second John.  One point of clarification: There are actually four books in the NT called John (and a fifth one he wrote called Revelation!) – There is the <em>Gospel</em> of John which we’ll talk about later, and then three letters from John called, oddly enough 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John. It is common to mix them up – but remember that the Gospel of John is a big old story at the beginning of the NT, and his letters are much, much shorter and towards the end.  I have removed the verse numbers, but there are a few points I want to come back to, so I’ve inserted my own numbers.\r\n\r\nAnyways, enough with the commentary, let’s read.\r\n\r\n(1)   This letter is from John, the elder.\r\n\r\n(2)   I am writing to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in the truth—as does everyone else who knows the truth— <sup> </sup>because the truth lives in us and will be with us forever.\r\n\r\n(3)   Grace, mercy, and peace, which come from God the Father and from Jesus Christ—the Son of the Father—will continue to be with us who live in truth and love.\r\n\r\n(4)   How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living according to the truth, just as the Father commanded. <sup> </sup>\r\n\r\n(5)   I am writing to remind you, dear friends, that we should love one another. This is not a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning. Love means doing what God has commanded us, and he has commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning.\r\n\r\n(6)   I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world. They deny that Jesus Christ came in a real body. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist.<sup> </sup>Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked so hard to achieve. Be diligent so that you receive your full reward. <sup> </sup>\r\n\r\n(7)   Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God. But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son.\r\n\r\nIf anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ, don’t invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement. Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work.\r\n\r\n(8)   I have much more to say to you, but I don’t want to do it with paper and ink. For I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face. Then our joy will be complete.\r\n\r\n(9)   Greetings from the children of your sister, chosen by God.\r\n\r\nThat’s it!  Guess what. Of the 66 books of the bible, no matter what else, you have read a full book of the Bible today.  One of the first things you should note is this: Most of the books of the New Testament are very, very short.

(Hint: If you''re Bible has some maps at the end, take a look)\r\n\r\nBy the way, I’m purposely trying to focus you on the ‘formula’ for a bit so that frankly you can know what not to pay too much attention to.  I’m not saying you should ignore – because you need to know the context in which the book was written, but you don’t need to be looking for theology in those places as much as context.  One very helpful thing to do if you find yourself a little stuck at the beginning or the end of a letter is to read a quick Bible Overview synopsis, usually found in many Study Bibles, to get that ‘context.’ Anyways – that’s my overview of ‘all’ the letters. Let’s get back to 2 John. Specifically, go back and look at (4).\r\n\r\n4.     What kind of relationship does John have with these people?\r\n\r\n5.     What does he do first? Why is that important? Is there a pattern we can apply to our own lives based on the “nature” of that interaction?\r\n\r\nLook again at (5).\r\n\r\n6.     What is it that John wants these people to do?  Does he give a practical example of that earlier in this letter?\r\n\r\n7.     Look at John 13:34. When, where and from whom did John first get this “command?”\r\n\r\n8.     Look at John 14:15. What is the basis for our obedience to Christ?\r\n\r\n9.     What is the difference between these two statements:\r\n- If you love me, keep my commandments\r\n- If you keep my commandments, I will love you.\r\n\r\n10.  Which one is the Biblical teaching? What difference does that make in how we approach Christ?\r\n\r\n11.  What is love? (Yeah, I know – that’s an easy one… NOT!)\r\n\r\nLook again at (6).\r\n\r\n12.  Does there seem to be a change in tone? Why? How can this be consistent with (5)?\r\n\r\n13.  What is the reward that John is afraid his church would lose?\r\n\r\n14.  Why is it that encouraging unbelievers would be unloving?\r\n\r\nLook again at (7).  Notice here that John is going to give some practical advice on the implications of (6). This is normal in just about every epistle in the Bible. There is a greeting (1-3) and a relationship(4). That is followed generally by a specific point that the writer really wants the recipient to get (5). Usually this is done because there is some kind of a problem (6) that could really screw things up.  But high-minded theology needs to be worked out in simple, practical, concrete applications, like in (7).\r\n\r\nIf you were to go back and read 2 Timothy, for example (and it’s a very good book – and almost as short), you’ll see this same pattern.  Paul – about ready to be killed incidently – writes a letter to Timothy. You will see Paul &amp; Timothy’s relationship, and then you will see that the entire letter can be boiled down to 2 Timothy 1:14 – HOLD FAST TO THAT WHICH YOU HAVE. But that principle is only as good as how well you see that borne out in day to day stuff.  The rest of the book are some suggestions on how that happens.\r\n\r\nBack in 2 John, in my (7) ask yourself:\r\n\r\n15.  What is this “relationship” anyway?\r\n\r\n16.  How do you know when love means to be in relationship and when it does not?\r\n\r\n17.  Again, why is it loving to <em>not </em> encourage someone who is anti-Christ?\r\n\r\nFinally, just a note about (8).\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth thinking through in (8) what John – one of the Twelve remember, a very busy man – thought about the in-person component of being church with other believers. Clearly he could write – but he sees the in-person part as the more important thing to do.  Any implications you take from that are your own J\r\n\r\nJohn clearly has more that he could say. Do you feel a little gipped that he doesn’t say it? Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a how-to manual for every action we would take?  But then again, is God’s purpose really to give a set of rules and regulations, or is it to have relationship with us?\r\n\r\nJust imagine, for instance, if I had a computer simulation from Susan, one which would tell me the appropriate answer for every situation, like when she asks, “Does this dress make me look fat?” Even if I knew the correct answer<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> to every situation, how would I start feel about that relationship, every time the program chimed in with the answer?\r\n\r\nIf God’s plan is that our joy might be complete, is a how-to manual really the right answer?\r\n\r\nYes, we can reduce what we read to principles and even applications for how we should behave – but ask yourself this: Is that all that Bible Study is? Is not perhaps a means of just enjoying a relationship with the God who inspired each of these letters? The point of Susan asking me about the dress has nothing to do with how she looks – it’s about the fact that I’m looking at her.\r\n\r\nOnce more, thanks everyone, and looking forward to seeing you on January 10, 2010.\r\n\r\n<hr size="1" /><a href="#_ftnref">[1]</a> I have pictures if you want.

It isn’t a bad assumption, but it is still one worth investigating. What we’ve been assuming is this – that we find Truth in the Bible.  After all, if we didn’t, then Bible Study would be no different than studying Shakespeare or Stephen King or Civil War History.  But why is that we think that (a) we can find Truth in the Scriptures and the (b) we believe that Scripture is in fact truth? This month, I’d like to ask one big question:\r\n<div id="cg_msg_content">\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Why do we believe what we believe?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWe evaluate all sorts of claims to Truth every day. We do it so naturally that we often don’t think about how we do it.\r\n\r\nWe believe, for instance, that the world is round, and not flat.  But why? You <em>could</em> prove this experientially – by flying around the world. You <em>could</em> prove this logically by observing a ship sailing away as it disappears beneath the horizon. You <em>could </em>study Genesis 1 and contemplate the “dome” of the heavens against which the birds fly or note that Job speaks of God hanging the earth upon nothingness in the heavens. Or, you <em>could</em> simply appeal to the fact that “everybody knows” the world is round.  Each of these arguments represent a different path to arriving at Truth that is not dependent on the feelings or opinions of the person making the argument.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of plagiarizing from John Wesley (which I am doing), I want to suggest four words to summarize these “sources of authority:”  Scripture, Tradition, Reason, and Experience.  Whenever we make a theological argument, we will be appealing to one or more of these four categories – and if we’re not, we’re just spouting an opinion or a feeling.\r\n\r\nNow, why is that important?  Imagine two people talking. One says, “There is a God.” The other says, “No there isn’t.”  Absent Scripture, Tradition, Reason, or Experience, the conversation quickly resembles something Jonathan and Rachel fill their conversations with.\r\n\r\nThis month, I want to tackle the book of 2 Timothy, and in doing so, examine why we study Scripture, go to church, and frankly, why we believe what we believe.\r\n\r\nBefore we go any further, please take the fifteen minutes or so that it will take to simply read the book.  We will come back to parts, but please first just read it in its entirety.\r\n\r\nWelcome back!  You did read it, right?  Let’s start by just doing some basic recall.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Who wrote this book, and to whom 	was it written?</li>\r\n	<li>Who are Eunice and Lois?</li>\r\n	<li>Of what should Timothy not be 	ashamed?</li>\r\n	<li>To what three jobs does Paul 	compare the Christian life in chapter 2?</li>\r\n	<li>What is Paul’s advice about 	“quarrelling with words”?</li>\r\n	<li>What will people be like in “the 	last days?”</li>\r\n	<li>What four things is all Scripture 	“profitable” for?</li>\r\n	<li>What kinds of teachers will people 	gather to themselves in “the last days?”</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nNotice in each of those questions, I’m not asking you to interpret or judge – I’m just sort of checking your recall.  If these questions are hard to answer, go back and re-read it. Again – it’s a short book.\r\n\r\nNow, let’s ask are next question:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>What is this book about?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIdeally, pick just a few words or one verse that sums up what Paul is trying to convey.  As a general hint, I’d suggest you look more at the beginning of the book (Chapter 1) moreso than the end.\r\n\r\nNow, let me also suggest to you that even though there are a lot of names in this book, most of them don’t really matter.  Let me take a moment and fill some details that might be helpful.\r\n<ol type="a">\r\n	<li>Obviously, Paul is the author.  	You probably also noticed that he mentioned he was “suffering for 	the Gospel,” and “in chains.”  Clues like these help us to 	really nail down some things about when this book was written, and 	there is just about universal agreement by scholars about the 	context.  We know historically that Paul was a great missionary – 	he started a lot of churches – and as a result got a lot of 	religious leaders rather angry at him. We know from the Book of Acts 	(written by Paul’s companion Luke that Paul mentions in Chapter 4) 	that eventually he was thrown into prison for several years, until 	eventually he was beheaded. The general tone of the book suggests 	this was probably Paul’s last letter, shortly before his 	execution.</li>\r\n	<li>Timothy is the person to whom Paul 	is writing. From Chapter 1, we know that his mother (Eunice) and his 	grandmother (Lois) were both Christians, and from other letters we 	know that Paul asked Timothy to pastor one of the churches that Paul 	started – probably the one in Ephesus, a large city on the Turkish 	coast. An analogy in today’s terms might be like Franklin Graham – 	son of Billy Graham – pastoring a church in a city like New York.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n--  The lesser characters --\r\n<ol type="a">\r\n	<li>Lois &amp; Eunice, as we said, are 	Timothy’s grandmother and mother. They just show the history.</li>\r\n	<li>Jannes &amp; Jambres are the names 	traditionally given to the magicians that Moses encountered when 	trying to get Pharaoh to  “let my people go.”  If you remember 	the scene where Yul Brenner throws his rod on the ground and it 	turns into a snake, then some Egyptian magicians do the same thing, 	but then Moses’ snake eats up the other snakes, then you are 	remembering Jannes &amp; Jambres.</li>\r\n	<li>Luke is the author of the Book of 	Luke &amp; Acts, and as we see here, a guy who travels with Paul.</li>\r\n	<li>Mark (called John Mark) is a young 	guy who had at one point travelled with Paul but then who “chickened 	out” and left. Paul was ticked, but you’ll notice here he’s 	now forgiven him.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAll of that’s fun to know, but not really central, right?  The main point of this book, as I see it, can be summarized in two words: “Hold On!”  Why?\r\n<ol type="a">\r\n	<li>There are a lot of people who want 	to convince you that what they believe is right.</li>\r\n	<li>Much of what people believe is 	what they <em>want</em> to believe rather than established truth.</li>\r\n	<li>What you already know <em>is</em> true, &amp; we know that from Scripture, Tradition, Reason, &amp; 	Experience, so…</li>\r\n	<li>Hold On!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nNotice that there is a context – Paul is telling Timothy, “Hold on to what you know.”  There was a fixed point in time for that exact message from Paul to Timothy. Notice also that the same bit of advice is relevant for us today.  That’s how Bible Study works. See what was being said then; See what we share in common today; See what advice it holds for us today.\r\n\r\nSo, let’s put all of this together:\r\n\r\n<em>The World</em>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>In Chapters 3 &amp; 4, what does 	Paul say the world will be like?</li>\r\n	<li>What does it mean to “scoff at 	God?”</li>\r\n	<li>What does it mean to say that 	people have “itching ears?”</li>\r\n	<li>Is this the world we live in 	today?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<em>How to evaluate Truth - Tradition</em>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>What kinds of things did Timothy 	learn from his mother &amp; grandmother?</li>\r\n	<li>Did Timothy get to choose what 	his mother &amp; grandmother would be like?</li>\r\n	<li>What can be dangerous about 	relying on Tradition to determine if something is or isn’t true?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<em>How to evaluate Truth – Reason</em>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>What is the danger of relying 	strictly on building good sounding arguments? (Hint: Look at 2 Tim 	2: 14 – 18; 3: 5 – 7; Isa 55: 8 – 9)</li>\r\n	<li>Does that mean we should never try 	use logic to figure out truth? (Hint: 2 Tim 2:20)</li>\r\n	<li>How do you know when  to rely on 	reason?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<em>How to evaluate Truth - Experience</em>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>In 2 Tim 3:10, Paul starts talking 	about his life.

What does that leave? Scripture!  Let’s look at 3:16.  Again,\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>What is Scripture good for? What 	does it do?</li>\r\n	<li>Why is it important that Scripture 	doesn’t change from generation to generation?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThink about the U.S. Constitution for a minute. Debates asides about how the Constitution is interpreted and whether or not the Supreme Court should or should not interpret it, what is the benefit of having a written set of rules to guide government? Imagine, for instance, that a very popular president, having served two terms, could still garner 95% of the vote to be declared “President-for-life.”  Even if 95% of the people want him to stay on, what would be the danger?

It isn’t a bad assumption, but it is still one worth investigating. What we’ve been assuming is this – that we find Truth in the Bible.  After all, if we didn’t, then Bible Study would be no different than studying Shakespeare or Stephen King or Civil War History.  But why is that we think that (a) we can find Truth in the Scriptures and the (b) we believe that Scripture is in fact truth? This month, I’d like to ask one big question:\n<div id="cg_msg_content">\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n	<li>Why do we believe what we believe?</li>\n</ol>\nWe evaluate all sorts of claims to Truth every day. We do it so naturally that we often don’t think about how we do it.\n\nWe believe, for instance, that the world is round, and not flat.  But why? You <em>could</em> prove this experientially – by flying around the world. You <em>could</em> prove this logically by observing a ship sailing away as it disappears beneath the horizon. You <em>could </em>study Genesis 1 and contemplate the “dome” of the heavens against which the birds fly or note that Job speaks of God hanging the earth upon nothingness in the heavens. Or, you <em>could</em> simply appeal to the fact that “everybody knows” the world is round.  Each of these arguments represent a different path to arriving at Truth that is not dependent on the feelings or opinions of the person making the argument.\n\nAt the risk of plagiarizing from John Wesley (which I am doing), I want to suggest four words to summarize these “sources of authority:”  Scripture, Tradition, Reason, and Experience.  Whenever we make a theological argument, we will be appealing to one or more of these four categories – and if we’re not, we’re just spouting an opinion or a feeling.\n\nNow, why is that important?  Imagine two people talking. One says, “There is a God.” The other says, “No there isn’t.”  Absent Scripture, Tradition, Reason, or Experience, the conversation quickly resembles something Jonathan and Rachel fill their conversations with.\n\nThis month, I want to tackle the book of 2 Timothy, and in doing so, examine why we study Scripture, go to church, and frankly, why we believe what we believe.\n\nBefore we go any further, please take the fifteen minutes or so that it will take to simply read the book.  We will come back to parts, but please first just read it in its entirety.\n\nWelcome back!  You did read it, right?  Let’s start by just doing some basic recall.\n<ol>\n	<li>Who wrote this book, and to whom 	was it written?</li>\n	<li>Who are Eunice and Lois?</li>\n	<li>Of what should Timothy not be 	ashamed?</li>\n	<li>To what three jobs does Paul 	compare the Christian life in chapter 2?</li>\n	<li>What is Paul’s advice about 	“quarrelling with words”?</li>\n	<li>What will people be like in “the 	last days?”</li>\n	<li>What four things is all Scripture 	“profitable” for?</li>\n	<li>What kinds of teachers will people 	gather to themselves in “the last days?”</li>\n</ol>\nNotice in each of those questions, I’m not asking you to interpret or judge – I’m just sort of checking your recall.  If these questions are hard to answer, go back and re-read it. Again – it’s a short book.\n\nNow, let’s ask are next question:\n<ol>\n	<li>What is this book about?</li>\n</ol>\nIdeally, pick just a few words or one verse that sums up what Paul is trying to convey.  As a general hint, I’d suggest you look more at the beginning of the book (Chapter 1) moreso than the end.\n\nNow, let me also suggest to you that even though there are a lot of names in this book, most of them don’t really matter.  Let me take a moment and fill some details that might be helpful.\n<ol type="a">\n	<li>Obviously, Paul is the author.  	You probably also noticed that he mentioned he was “suffering for 	the Gospel,” and “in chains.”  Clues like these help us to 	really nail down some things about when this book was written, and 	there is just about universal agreement by scholars about the 	context.  We know historically that Paul was a great missionary – 	he started a lot of churches – and as a result got a lot of 	religious leaders rather angry at him. We know from the Book of Acts 	(written by Paul’s companion Luke that Paul mentions in Chapter 4) 	that eventually he was thrown into prison for several years, until 	eventually he was beheaded. The general tone of the book suggests 	this was probably Paul’s last letter, shortly before his 	execution.</li>\n	<li>Timothy is the person to whom Paul 	is writing. From Chapter 1, we know that his mother (Eunice) and his 	grandmother (Lois) were both Christians, and from other letters we 	know that Paul asked Timothy to pastor one of the churches that Paul 	started – probably the one in Ephesus, a large city on the Turkish 	coast. An analogy in today’s terms might be like Franklin Graham – 	son of Billy Graham – pastoring a church in a city like New York.</li>\n</ol>\n--  The lesser characters --\n<ol type="a">\n	<li>Lois &amp; Eunice, as we said, are 	Timothy’s grandmother and mother. They just show the history.</li>\n	<li>Jannes &amp; Jambres are the names 	traditionally given to the magicians that Moses encountered when 	trying to get Pharaoh to  “let my people go.”  If you remember 	the scene where Yul Brenner throws his rod on the ground and it 	turns into a snake, then some Egyptian magicians do the same thing, 	but then Moses’ snake eats up the other snakes, then you are 	remembering Jannes &amp; Jambres.</li>\n	<li>Luke is the author of the Book of 	Luke &amp; Acts, and as we see here, a guy who travels with Paul.</li>\n	<li>Mark (called John Mark) is a young 	guy who had at one point travelled with Paul but then who “chickened 	out” and left. Paul was ticked, but you’ll notice here he’s 	now forgiven him.</li>\n</ol>\nAll of that’s fun to know, but not really central, right?  The main point of this book, as I see it, can be summarized in two words: “Hold On!”  Why?\n<ol type="a">\n	<li>There are a lot of people who want 	to convince you that what they believe is right.</li>\n	<li>Much of what people believe is 	what they <em>want</em> to believe rather than established truth.</li>\n	<li>What you already know <em>is</em> true, &amp; we know that from Scripture, Tradition, Reason, &amp; 	Experience, so…</li>\n	<li>Hold On!</li>\n</ol>\nNotice that there is a context – Paul is telling Timothy, “Hold on to what you know.”  There was a fixed point in time for that exact message from Paul to Timothy.

(305, 1, '2010-10-30 17:19:52', '2010-10-30 22:19:52', '<h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a Saint?</h2>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: center;">Luke 6:20-31</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">A Sermon delivered bt the Rev. John Thomas Sheehan</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">All Saint’s Day</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">October 31, 2010</p>\r\nA question I ask myself about this time every year is, <strong>"What is a saint?"</strong> There are a couple ways to answer the question. The first, and the most obvious given that we are in the middle of the football season, is that a Saint is a member of the football team located in New Orleans. Of course, this is not the answer I’m looking for.\r\n\r\nOthers will look at the, Catholic definition for a saint:\r\n\r\n"someone who has passed away who was a strong Christian through their lives,\r\n\r\nand who had some miracle attributed to them after their death."\r\n\r\nEven though the Catholic Church is rigorous with their desire for proof for miracles, I’m not sure miracles play a major role in the qualifications for sainthood.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess I’ll stick with the Prayer Book definition: (862) What is the communion of saints?\r\n\r\n"The communion of saints is the whole family of God, the living and the dead, those whom we love\r\n\r\nand those whom we hurt, bound together in Christ by sacrament, prayer, and praise."\r\n\r\nThe early Protestants did a good job of democratizing our understanding of sainthood. They said that there aren’t different levels of Christianity. There aren’t normal Christians and Super Christians. Instead, once we have accepted Christ, we are all saved and therefore, we are all saints. A saint isn’t a perfect person, a saint is a forgiven sinner. And today, as we celebrate All Saints Day, we remember the saints who have gone before us,\r\n\r\nguiding our path with their witness, and we also look at our own calling as saints.\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualifications for Sainthood? Well, since the concept of saint has been brought to the masses, since we recognize that all of us are saints, we might choose to allow ourselves the easy way out. We might allow ourselves to figure that since we’ve been saved, since we’ve prayed the prayer, We are where we need to be and we don’t need to do much else. If we allow ourselves to live this way, I believe that we are making a mistake. You see, I don’t think that it’s an accident that the scripture for All Saints Day comes from Luke 6.\r\n\r\nHere Jesus is describing what it is he calls us to be as his followers. Jesus is telling us what the qualifications for a saint are. Jesus is reminding us of what it means to be a child of God. There’s nothing in here about praying a prayer or accepting Jesus into your heart. No, Jesus is calling us to something deeper and more meaningful.\r\n\r\nJesus is calling us to faith and faithfulness.\r\n\r\nHere, in Luke 6, we have a description of what a child of God looks like; here we have the qualifications if we are interested in taking that on in our lives.\r\n\r\nI think it’s important, with our protestant theology, to realize that this description, that these qualifications, aren’t just for a few, they are for all saints, they are for all Christians. And so when we look at them we find ourselves wanting:\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\nBlessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nBlessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied.\r\n\r\nBlessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.\r\n\r\nBlessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you,\r\n\r\ninsult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.\r\n\r\nRejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven.\r\n\r\nLove your enemies, do good to those who hate you,\r\n\r\nbless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.\r\n\r\nIf someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also.\r\n\r\nIf someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic.\r\n\r\nGive to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.\r\n\r\nDo to others as you would have them do to you.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\nI squirm when I read these verses. First of all there’s the whole part about hungering and weeping and being poor. It seems that God wants his children to be poor. This doesn’t match what I’ve been taught about Christianity. Doesn’t God want the best for me? Well, yes, but the best doesn’t necessarily have to do with money.\r\n\r\nIt’ much easier to read Matthews sermon where Jesus talks about being poor in spirit and hungering for righteousness. And I know that Jesus taught using those words some times. But other times, Jesus taught\r\n\r\nusing these words and I find them a bit harder to accept. Being poor, weeping, hungering, these are good things?\r\n\r\nWell, God makes promises to those who endure these things, because he honors people who go through them.\r\n\r\nIn Jesus’ eyes, being a saint is about suffering for God. Again, I squirm when I read this. I’m not comfortable with this message, but that is what it is. This is not the Christianity that I thought I understood. There was nothing in it about suffering. Oh, there are Christians in other parts of the world who have to suffer for their faith, there are Christians in the past who were persecuted because of what they believed, and we can look up to these martyrs, but we also thank God that we don’t have to deal with the things they deal with.\r\n\r\nAnd then we come to this passage, telling us that God blesses those who are persecuted, telling us that the riches the world has to offer aren’t all they’re cracked up to be, telling us that suffering for the sake of Christ is actually a good thing.\r\n\r\nJesus didn’t just preach this, he lived it. Jesus lived a life of suffering. Jesus could have come to earth as a king. Jesus could have ruled from a palace with many servants. But he chose the life of a homeless man during his three year ministry. He chose to travel from town to town and he learn to rely on those around him to meet his needs. He could encourage his disciples to ask God for their daily bread because that is the way he lived. So he wasn’t looking down at the poor when he told them they would be blessed. He wasn’t giving platitudes from on high. He was speaking from among them. Jesus knew what hunger was, He knew what it was to weep. These were real things to him. And Jesus knew what it meant to suffer for his message. Because, he suffered in the ultimate way as he headed to the cross. These things were real to him. This is the way he lived. And he told his disciples, and I believe, he is telling us as well, that this is the way the child of God is to live.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>Have you turned your life over to Jesus? Terrific! Did you pray a prayer asking Jesus into your heart? Wonderful! OK now, find a way to start living it. Start being a saint, which we all are, which means that we are called to a difficult life. It means that life can and often will be difficult. It means a life of sacrifice. It means that you can’t always put your own needs first.\r\n\r\nWe often forget about the work involved in being a saint, and yet, there it is.\r\n\r\nThere aren’t levels of Christianity. There aren’t normal Christians and then Super Christians who really have to work at it. We are all called to work at it in our own way in our own lives.\r\n\r\nThink back to those saints who have gone before. Think back to parents and grandparents, aunts an uncles, friends and neighbors, that truly lived the life. Think of the example that they have been to you. And remember how much they put into their faith. Remember how God came first in their lives. And know that if we want to truly honor them then we are called to the same life of sacrifice for our faith. And then we will find the same blessing in Jesus’ eyes that they found when we are willing to suffer for God.\r\n\r\nPaul tells us that we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses. He reminds us that we are not alone in our faith. We can remember those who have gone before, we know that there are children of God around the world today. He offers this comfort. But it is not only comfort. It is also encouragement for us to struggle on.\r\n\r\nSince we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, we can struggle on in the faith. Since we have saints who have gone before us, Since we are standing on their shoulders, we cannot just sit back on our laurels and allow our faith to be simple and easy.\r\n\r\nSo let us seek to be the children of God that Jesus calls us to be. Let us seek to be the saints that Jesus calls us to be. It isn’t easy, but we’re in good company, and we have many saints who have gone before us cheering us on and encouraging us to move forward.\r\n\r\nLet us pray: Dear Heavenly Father, we give you thanks for all your saints throughout the ages, who have revealed your word in faithfulness and who have enabled the proclamation of your redeeming grace in Jesus the Christ to be passed on from generation to generation. Through the power of your Holy Spirit, inspire us and give us the courage to witness to the Gospel through our own lives, so that it might continue to nurture faith for generations to come.

John Thomas Sheehan</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">All Saint’s Day</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">October 31, 2010</p>\nA question I ask myself about this time every year is, <strong>"What is a saint?"</strong> There are a couple ways to answer the question. The first, and the most obvious given that we are in the middle of the football season, is that a Saint is a member of the football team located in New Orleans. Of course, this is not the answer I’m looking for.\n\nOthers will look at the, Catholic definition for a saint:\n\n"someone who has passed away who was a strong Christian through their lives,\n\nand who had some miracle attributed to them after their death."\n\nEven though the Catholic Church is rigorous with their desire for proof for miracles, I’m not sure miracles play a major role in the qualifications for sainthood.\n\nSo, I guess I’ll stick with the Prayer Book definition: (862) What is the communion of saints?\n\n"The communion of saints is the whole family of God, the living and the dead, those whom we love\n\nand those whom we hurt, bound together in Christ by sacrament, prayer, and praise."\n\nThe early Protestants did a good job of democratizing our understanding of sainthood. They said that there aren’t different levels of Christianity. There aren’t normal Christians and Super Christians. Instead, once we have accepted Christ, we are all saved and therefore, we are all saints. A saint isn’t a perfect person, a saint is a forgiven sinner. And today, as we celebrate All Saints Day, we remember the saints who have gone before us,\n\nguiding our path with their witness, and we also look at our own calling as saints.\n\nWhat are the qualifications for Sainthood? Well, since the concept of saint has been brought to the masses, since we recognize that all of us are saints, we might choose to allow ourselves the easy way out. We might allow ourselves to figure that since we’ve been saved, since we’ve prayed the prayer, We are where we need to be and we don’t need to do much else. If we allow ourselves to live this way, I believe that we are making a mistake. You see, I don’t think that it’s an accident that the scripture for All Saints Day comes from Luke 6.\n\nHere Jesus is describing what it is he calls us to be as his followers. Jesus is telling us what the qualifications for a saint are. Jesus is reminding us of what it means to be a child of God. There’s nothing in here about praying a prayer or accepting Jesus into your heart. No, Jesus is calling us to something deeper and more meaningful.\n\nJesus is calling us to faith and faithfulness.\n\nHere, in Luke 6, we have a description of what a child of God looks like; here we have the qualifications if we are interested in taking that on in our lives.\n\nI think it’s important, with our protestant theology, to realize that this description, that these qualifications, aren’t just for a few, they are for all saints, they are for all Christians.

And so when we look at them we find ourselves wanting:\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\nBlessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nBlessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied.\r\n\r\nBlessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.\r\n\r\nBlessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you,\r\n\r\ninsult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.\r\n\r\nRejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven.\r\n\r\nLove your enemies, do good to those who hate you,\r\n\r\nbless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.\r\n\r\nIf someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also.\r\n\r\nIf someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic.\r\n\r\nGive to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.\r\n\r\nDo to others as you would have them do to you.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\nI squirm when I read these verses. First of all there’s the whole part about hungering and weeping and being poor. It seems that God wants his children to be poor. This doesn’t match what I’ve been taught about Christianity. Doesn’t God want the best for me? Well, yes, but the best doesn’t necessarily have to do with money.\r\n\r\nIt’ much easier to read Matthews sermon where Jesus talks about being poor in spirit and hungering for righteousness. And I know that Jesus taught using those words some times. But other times, Jesus taught\r\n\r\nusing these words and I find them a bit harder to accept. Being poor, weeping, hungering, these are good things?\r\n\r\nWell, God makes promises to those who endure these things, because he honors people who go through them.\r\n\r\nIn Jesus’ eyes, being a saint is about suffering for God. Again, I squirm when I read this. I’m not comfortable with this message, but that is what it is. This is not the Christianity that I thought I understood. There was nothing in it about suffering. Oh, there are Christians in other parts of the world who have to suffer for their faith, there are Christians in the past who were persecuted because of what they believed, and we can look up to these martyrs, but we also thank God that we don’t have to deal with the things they deal with.\r\n\r\nAnd then we come to this passage, telling us that God blesses those who are persecuted, telling us that the riches the world has to offer aren’t all they’re cracked up to be, telling us that suffering for the sake of Christ is actually a good thing.\r\n\r\nJesus didn’t just preach this, he lived it. Jesus lived a life of suffering. Jesus could have come to earth as a king. Jesus could have ruled from a palace with many servants. But he chose the life of a homeless man during his three year ministry. He chose to travel from town to town and he learn to rely on those around him to meet his needs. He could encourage his disciples to ask God for their daily bread because that is the way he lived. So he wasn’t looking down at the poor when he told them they would be blessed. He wasn’t giving platitudes from on high. He was speaking from among them. Jesus knew what hunger was, He knew what it was to weep. These were real things to him. And Jesus knew what it meant to suffer for his message. Because, he suffered in the ultimate way as he headed to the cross. These things were real to him. This is the way he lived. And he told his disciples, and I believe, he is telling us as well, that this is the way the child of God is to live.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>Have you turned your life over to Jesus? Terrific! Did you pray a prayer asking Jesus into your heart? Wonderful! OK now, find a way to start living it. Start being a saint, which we all are, which means that we are called to a difficult life. It means that life can and often will be difficult. It means a life of sacrifice. It means that you can’t always put your own needs first.\r\n\r\nWe often forget about the work involved in being a saint, and yet, there it is.\r\n\r\nThere aren’t levels of Christianity. There aren’t normal Christians and then Super Christians who really have to work at it. We are all called to work at it in our own way in our own lives.\r\n\r\nThink back to those saints who have gone before. Think back to parents and grandparents, aunts an uncles, friends and neighbors, that truly lived the life. Think of the example that they have been to you. And remember how much they put into their faith. Remember how God came first in their lives. And know that if we want to truly honor them then we are called to the same life of sacrifice for our faith. And then we will find the same blessing in Jesus’ eyes that they found when we are willing to suffer for God.\r\n\r\nPaul tells us that we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses. He reminds us that we are not alone in our faith. We can remember those who have gone before, we know that there are children of God around the world today. He offers this comfort. But it is not only comfort. It is also encouragement for us to struggle on.\r\n\r\nSince we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, we can struggle on in the faith. Since we have saints who have gone before us, Since we are standing on their shoulders, we cannot just sit back on our laurels and allow our faith to be simple and easy.\r\n\r\nSo let us seek to be the children of God that Jesus calls us to be. Let us seek to be the saints that Jesus calls us to be. It isn’t easy, but we’re in good company, and we have many saints who have gone before us cheering us on and encouraging us to move forward.\r\n\r\nLet us pray: Dear Heavenly Father, we give you thanks for all your saints throughout the ages, who have revealed your word in faithfulness and who have enabled the proclamation of your redeeming grace in Jesus the Christ to be passed on from generation to generation. Through the power of your Holy Spirit, inspire us and give us the courage to witness to the Gospel through our own lives, so that it might continue to nurture faith for generations to come. This we ask in Jesus’ holy name.

(309, 1, '2010-10-30 17:20:34', '2010-10-30 22:20:34', '<h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a Saint?</h2>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: center;">Luke 6:20-31</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">A Sermon delivered bt the Rev. John Thomas Sheehan</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">All Saint’s Day</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">October 31, 2010</p>\r\nA question I ask myself about this time every year is, <strong>"What is a saint?"</strong> There are a couple ways to answer the question. The first, and the most obvious given that we are in the middle of the football season, is that a Saint is a member of the football team located in New Orleans. Of course, this is not the answer I’m looking for.\r\n\r\nOthers will look at the, Catholic definition for a saint:\r\n\r\n"someone who has passed away who was a strong Christian through their lives,\r\n\r\nand who had some miracle attributed to them after their death."\r\n\r\nEven though the Catholic Church is rigorous with their desire for proof for miracles, I’m not sure miracles play a major role in the qualifications for sainthood.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess I’ll stick with the Prayer Book definition: (862) What is the communion of saints?\r\n\r\n"The communion of saints is the whole family of God, the living and the dead, those whom we love\r\n\r\nand those whom we hurt, bound together in Christ by sacrament, prayer, and praise."\r\n\r\nThe early Protestants did a good job of democratizing our understanding of sainthood. They said that there aren’t different levels of Christianity. There aren’t normal Christians and Super Christians. Instead, once we have accepted Christ, we are all saved and therefore, we are all saints. A saint isn’t a perfect person, a saint is a forgiven sinner. And today, as we celebrate All Saints Day, we remember the saints who have gone before us,\r\n\r\nguiding our path with their witness, and we also look at our own calling as saints.\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualifications for Sainthood? Well, since the concept of saint has been brought to the masses, since we recognize that all of us are saints, we might choose to allow ourselves the easy way out. We might allow ourselves to figure that since we’ve been saved, since we’ve prayed the prayer, We are where we need to be and we don’t need to do much else. If we allow ourselves to live this way, I believe that we are making a mistake. You see, I don’t think that it’s an accident that the scripture for All Saints Day comes from Luke 6.\r\n\r\nHere Jesus is describing what it is he calls us to be as his followers. Jesus is telling us what the qualifications for a saint are. Jesus is reminding us of what it means to be a child of God. There’s nothing in here about praying a prayer or accepting Jesus into your heart. No, Jesus is calling us to something deeper and more meaningful.\r\n\r\nJesus is calling us to faith and faithfulness.\r\n\r\nHere, in Luke 6, we have a description of what a child of God looks like; here we have the qualifications if we are interested in taking that on in our lives.\r\n\r\nI think it’s important, with our protestant theology, to realize that this description, that these qualifications, aren’t just for a few, they are for all saints, they are for all Christians.

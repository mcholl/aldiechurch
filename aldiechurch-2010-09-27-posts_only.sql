Basically we figure you''re an adult, and know that this is a solemn ceremony memorializing the sacrifice that Jesus made on our behalf. For that reason, both we and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:27-29&amp;version=NLT">Scripture</a> suggest you not take it lightly, but we do encourage <em>all</em> baptised Christians (regardless of denomination) to join.  Typically, we suggest that younger children should be confirmed (usually around the age of 11 or 12) before actually taking the elements, but again, we trust you to make that decision.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason you are not comfortable taking communion, please come forward anyway to receive a blessing. If you are concerned about catching anything, you needn''t - our priest uses rubbing alcohol to clean his hands before serving, and the vessels are thoroughly washed after every service.  Finally, if you would prefer, a separate cup for continction (dipping) is available.\r\n\r\n<em><em>So, what is communion?</em></em> If you were observing it like an anthropologist, this is what you''d see:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The Priest pours a cup of wine and prays over a piece of bread.</li>\r\n	<li>Everybody in the church will get out of their seats (by rows), and stand in line until there is space available to kneel at the altar.</li>\r\n	<li>When you get to the altar, if you do NOT want to take the elements, simply cross your hands over your chest, and the priest will give you a blessing. You can simply leave at this point.</li>\r\n	<li>Those receiving communion will hold their hand out for the bread, which the priest will place on the hand. One can either eat the bread or wait until the cup comes and dip it.</li>\r\n	<li>The cup of wine is then brought, and you either take a sip or dip your bread.</li>\r\n	<li>People then return to their seat.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIt''s not that scary. What is happening, however, is that we are playing out the "Last Supper," the last passover which Jesus celebrated, the night before he was sentenced to death on the cross. While the ceremony he was celebrating remembered the Israelites being rescued from Egypt even as the Egyptians were being killed, Jesus used the ceremony to show that he was rescuing his followers from Sin, and would die in the process.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more, please contact our rector', 'How do you do communion?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '79-revision-3', '', '', '2010-09-23 16:01:02', '2010-09-23 16:01:02', '', 79, 'http://doverknoll.com/aldiechurch/archives/213', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
